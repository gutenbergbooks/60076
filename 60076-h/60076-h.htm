<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="smaller">BY MRS. HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In these pages, a woman, a wife and mother, speaks the
sorrows and oppressions of which she has been the witness
and the victim.</p>

<p>It is because her sorrows and her oppressions are those of
thousands, who, suffering like her, cannot or dare not speak
for themselves, that she thus gives this history to the public.</p>

<p>It is no sensational story, but a plain, unvarnished tale of
truth, stranger and sadder than fiction.</p>

<p>Our day has seen a glorious breaking of fetters. The slave-pens
of the South have become a nightmare of the past; the
auction-block and whipping-post have given place to the church
and school-house; and the songs of emancipated millions are
heard through our land.</p>

<p>May we not then hope that the hour is come to loose the
bonds of a cruel slavery whose chains have cut into the very
hearts of thousands of our sisters—a slavery which debases
and degrades womanhood, motherhood, and the family?</p>

<p>Let every happy wife and mother who reads these lines
give her their sympathy, prayers, and aid to free her sisters
from this degrading bondage. Let all the womanhood of the
country stand united for them. There is a power in combined
enlightened sentiment and sympathy before which every
form of injustice and cruelty <em>must</em> finally go down.</p>

<p>May He who came to break every yoke hasten this deliverance!</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/line1.jpg" width="200" height="25" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the fall of the year 1869, a few earnest, thinking men,
members of the Mormon Church, and living in Salt Lake
City, inaugurated what was regarded at the time as a grand
schism. Those who had watched with anxiety the progress of
Mormonism, hailed the “New Movement” as the harbinger
of the work of disintegration so long anticipated by the
thoughtful-minded Saints, and believed that the opposition to
Theocracy, then begun, would continue until the extraordinary
assumptions of the Mormon priesthood were exploded, and
Mormonism itself should lose its political <em>status</em> and find its
place only among the singular sects of the day.</p>

<p>It was freely predicted that Woman, in her turn, would
accept her part in the work of reformation, take up the
marriage question among the Saints, and make an end of
Polygamy.</p>

<p>Little did I imagine, at that period, that any such mission
as that which I have since realized as mine, was in the Providence
of Time awaiting me, or that I should ever have the
boldness, either with tongue or pen, to plead the cause of the
Women of Utah. But, impelled by those unseen influences
which shape our destinies, I took my stand with the “heretics;”
and, as it happened, my own was the first woman’s name enrolled
in their cause.</p>

<p>The circumstances which wrought a change in my own
life produced a corresponding revolution in the life of my
husband.</p>

<p>In withdrawing from the Mormon Church, we laid ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
our associations, and the labours of over twenty years,
upon the altar, and took up the burden of life anew. We had
sacrificed everything in obedience to the “counsel” of Brigham
Young; and my husband, to give a new direction to his
mind, and also to form some plan for our future life, thought
it advisable that he should visit New York. He did so; and
shortly after employed himself in writing a history of the
“Rocky Mountain Saints,” which has since been published.</p>

<p>In course of time, the burden of providing for a large family,
and the anxiety and care of conducting successfully a business
among a people who make it a religious duty to sternly set
their faces against those who dissent from their faith, exhausted
my physical and mental strength. Considering, therefore,
that change might be beneficial to me, and my own personal
affairs urgently calling me to New York City, I followed
my husband thither.</p>

<p>On my way East I met a highly-valued friend of my family,
who, in the course of our journey together over the Pacific
Railroad, enthusiastically urged me to tell the story of my
past life, and to give to the world what I knew about Polygamy.
I had been repeatedly advised to do so by friends at home,
but up to that time no plan had been arranged for carrying
out the suggestion.</p>

<p>I had hardly arrived in New York before the electric messenger
announced that a severe snow-storm was raging on the
vast plains between the Rocky Mountains and the Missouri
River, and for several weeks all traffic over the Union Pacific
Railroad was interrupted, and I could not return to my home
in the distant West.</p>

<p>That unlooked-for snow-blockade became seriously annoying;
for not only was I most anxious to return to my children,
but also, never having known an idle hour, I could not live
without something to do. At that moment of unsettled feeling,
a lady-friend, with whom I was visiting, suggested again
“<em>the book</em>;” and she would not permit me to leave her house
until she had exacted from me a promise that it should be
written.</p>

<p>Next morning I began my task in earnest. I faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
kept my room and laboured unremittingly; and in three weeks
the manuscript of my little work on “Polygamy in Utah” was
completed. It was very kindly welcomed by the press—both
secular and religious—and for this I was sincerely grateful.
I had not, up to that time, thought of much else than its effect
upon the people of Utah; but the voluminous notices which
that little book received showed the deep interest which the
people of the United States had taken in “the Mormon question,”
and how ardently they desired to see the extinction of
the polygamic institution among the Saints.</p>

<p>In Salt Lake City I was so situated that I was daily—I
might almost say hourly—brought in contact with visitors
to the Modern Zion; for, during the summer, thousands of
travellers pass over the Pacific Railroad. Not a few of these
called to see me; and I received from ladies and gentlemen—whose
kind interest in my welfare I felt very deeply—many
personal attentions, many words of sympathy and encouragement,
and many intelligent and useful suggestions in respect
to my future life. Indeed, I saw myself quite unexpectedly,
and, I may truthfully say, without my own desire, become an
object of interest.</p>

<p>By the earnest suggestions of friends and strangers, and
by the widely published opinions of the press, I was made to
feel that I had only <em>begun</em> my work—that I had but partly
drawn aside the veil that covered the worst oppression and degradation
of woman ever known in a civilized country. Nearly
all who spoke to me expressed their surprise that intelligent
men and women should be found in communion with the Mormon
Church, in which it was so clearly evident that the teachings
of Christianity had been supplanted by an attempt to
imitate the barbarism of Oriental nations in a long past age,
and the sweet influences of the religion of Jesus were superseded
by the most objectionable practices of the ancient Jews.
How persons of education and refinement could ever have
embraced a faith that prostrated them at the feet of the Mormon
Prophet, and his successor Brigham Young, was to the
inquiring mind a perfect mystery.</p>

<p>The numerous questions which I had to answer, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
explanations which I had to give, showed me that my little
book had only whetted the appetite of the intelligent investigator,
and that there was a general call for <em>a woman’s book</em>
on Mormonism—a book that should reveal <em>the inner life</em> of
the Saints,—exhibit the influences which had contributed to
draw Christian people away from Christian Churches to the
standard of the American Prophet, Joseph Smith, and subject
them to the power of that organization which has, since his
death, subjugated the mass of the Mormon people in Utah to
the will and wickedness of the Priesthood under the leadership
of Brigham Young.</p>

<p>A few months after the publication of my first book, I was
invited to lecture upon “Polygamy in Utah;” and wherever I
spoke I observed the same spirit of inquiry, and met with a
renewed demand for more of circumstance and narrative—which
I had, from a sense of personal delicacy, withheld in
my former work.</p>

<p>I saw no way of satisfying myself and others than by
accepting the rather spiteful invitation of a certain Mormon
paper to “<span class="smcap">Tell it all</span>;” and this, in a narrative of my own
personal experience, which I now present to the reader, I
have endeavoured to do. Not being in any sense a literary
woman, or making any pretensions as a writer, I hope to
escape severe criticism from the public and the press. I
had a simple story to tell—the story of my life and of the
wrongs of women in Utah. Startling and terrible facts have
fallen under my observation. These also I have related; but
my constant effort has been to tell my story in the plainest,
simplest way, and, while avoiding exaggeration, never to shrink
from a straightforward statement of facts. I have disguised
nothing, and palliated nothing; and I feel assured that those
who from their actual and intimate acquaintance with Mormonism
in Utah as it really is, are capable of passing a just
and impartial judgment upon my story, will declare without
hesitation that I have told “<em>the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth</em>.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">MY EARLY LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The story which I propose to tell in these pages is a plain,
unexaggerated record of facts which have come immediately
under my own notice, or which I have myself personally
experienced.</p>

<p>Much that to the reader may seem altogether incredible,
would to a Mormon mind appear simply a matter of ordinary
every-day occurrence with which every one in Utah is supposed
to be perfectly familiar. The reader must please remember
that I am not telling—as so many writers have told in
newspaper correspondence and sensational stories—the hasty
and incorrect statements and opinions gleaned during a short
visit to Salt Lake City; but my own experience—the story of
a faith, strange, wild, and terrible it may be, but which was
once so intimately enwoven with all my associations that it
became a part of my very existence itself; and facts, the too
true reality of which there are living witnesses by hundreds,
and even thousands, who could attest if only they would.</p>

<p>With the reader’s permission I shall briefly sketch my experience
from the very beginning.</p>

<p>I was born in the year 1829, in St. Heliers, Jersey—one of
the islands of the English Channel.</p>

<p>From my earliest recollection I was favourably disposed to
religious influences, and when only fourteen years of age I
became a member of the Baptist Church, of which my father
and mother were also members. With the simplicity and
enthusiasm of youth I was devoted to the religious faith of
the denomination to which I had attached myself, and sought
to live in a manner which should be acceptable to God.</p>

<p>My childhood passed away without the occurrence of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
events which would be worthy of mention, although, of course,
my mind was even then receiving that religious bias which
afterwards led me to adopt the faith of the Latter-day Saints.
Like most girls in their teens I had a natural love of dress—a
weakness, if such it be, of the sex generally. I was not
extravagant, for that I could not be; but thirty years ago
members of dissenting churches were more staid in their
dress and demeanour and were less of the world, I think, than
they are to-day. In plainness of dress the Methodists and
Baptists much resembled the Quakers. My girlish weakness
caused me to be the subject of many a reprimand from older
church-members who were rather strict in their views. I
well remember one smooth-faced, pious, corpulent brother,
who was old enough to be my father, saying to me one day:
“My dear young sister, were it not for your love of dress, I
have seriously thought that I would some day make you my
wife.” I wickedly resolved that if a few bright coloured
ribbons would disgust my pious admirer, it should not be my
fault if he still continued to think of me. But many of our
other church-members were more lenient. Our good minister
in particular bore with my imperfections, as he said, on account
of my youth and inexperience; and later still, when I
was ready to leave my native island, an extra ribbon or a
fashionable dress had not affected my standing in the Baptist
denomination.</p>

<p>I mention these trifles, not because I attach any importance
to them in themselves, but because similar religious tendencies
and a devotional feeling were almost universally found
to be the causes which induced men and women to join the
Mormon Church. From among Roman Catholics, who place
unquestioning confidence in their priesthood, and also from
among persons predisposed to infidelity, came few, if any,
converts to Mormonism. But it was from among the religiously
inclined, the Evangelical Protestants of the Old World,
that the greater number of proselytes came.</p>

<p>But to return to my story. I was one of the younger members
of a large family; and when I thought of the future I
readily saw that if I desired a position in life I should have to
make it for myself; and this I resolved to do. I began by
consulting all my friends who I thought would be able to
counsel or assist me in carrying out my determination; and
before long I found the opportunity which I sought. An
English lady, the wife of a captain in the British army, to
whom I had confided my aspirations, proposed—although I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was not yet fifteen years of age—to take me with her to
France, in the temporary capacity of governess, to her children,
assuring me at the same time that she would advance
my interests in every possible way after our arrival.</p>

<p>This lady and her husband were as kind to me as my own
parents could have been; and soon after our arrival in France
they procured for me a situation in one of the best schools in
St. Brieux, called the Maison-Martin, where, young as I was, I
engaged myself to teach the young ladies fancy-needlework
and embroidery, as well as to give lessons in English. Some
of the elder girls, I soon found, were further advanced in fancy-needlework
and some other matters than I was myself. This,
of course, I did not tell them; but to supply my deficiency I
spent many a midnight hour in study and in preparing myself
to give the advanced instructions which would be required by
my pupils on the following day. For some time after I began
my work as teacher in that school, I spent the whole of my
salary in paying for private lessons to keep me in advance of
my pupils. It was for awhile a severe task and a strain upon
my youthful energies; but I have never since regretted it,
as it gave an impulse to my mind that has remained with me
through life.</p>

<p>I had not been more than six months in my situation when
the parents of one of the pupils objected to the school retaining
a Protestant teacher, and I was consequently given to
understand that unless I consented to be instructed, if nothing
more, in the Roman Catholic faith, I could not remain in my
present position. This was my first experience of that religious
intolerance of which I afterwards saw so much. The
principal of the establishment, however, being very kindly
disposed towards me, advised me to submit, and it was finally
agreed that I should be allowed twelve months for instruction
and consideration.</p>

<p>During this probationary year I attended mass every morning
from seven to eight o’clock, and was present at vespers at
least three times a week. Every Saturday morning I accompanied
my pupils to the confessional, where I had to remain
from seven o’clock till noon; after which we returned to
breakfast. On Sundays there was the usual morning mass,
and after that high mass; and in the afternoon, from two to
four, we listened to a sermon. In addition to all these services,
at which I was expected to “assist,” a very good-looking, interesting
young priest was appointed to attend to the spiritual
instruction of the young Protestant, as they called me, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
school hours. He saw me frequently, but he was ill-qualified
to instruct me in the Catholic faith or to remove my doubts,
for he was not himself too happy in the sacerdotal robe. At
first he aimed at convincing me that the apostolic priesthood
vested in the fishermen of Galilee had descended in unbroken
succession in the Church of Rome; but he seemed to me
much more inclined for a flirtation than for argument; I
thought I could at times discover something of regret on his
own part at having taken holy orders; and in after years I
heard that he had abandoned his profession.</p>

<p>To the numerous stories of Catholic oppression and artifice
in undermining Protestants and seducing them from their
faith, I cannot add my own testimony. Those among whom I
lived very naturally desired that I should be instructed in
their religion, and join the church to which they belonged;
but their bearing towards me was ever kind and respectful;
although when the twelve months of probation had expired,
I found myself as much attached to the religion of my childhood
as ever, and had in consequence to resign my situation.
I had made many warm friends in the school, and none were
kinder to me than the principal, who proved her attachment by
finding for me a lucrative situation in a wealthy private family.</p>

<p>My new position was a decided advance in social life. The
family consisted of husband and wife, two children, the husband’s
brother, and an elderly uncle. The little girls were,
when I first knew them, of the ages of five and seven years
respectively. The young gentleman alluded to—the husband’s
brother—had been educated for the church, but when the
proper time came had refused to take orders; the uncle was
a fine old gentleman, a retired general in the French army,
and a bachelor. Altogether they formed as happy a domestic
circle as I had ever known. The position which I occupied
among them was that of governess and English teacher to
the two little girls.</p>

<p>My young charges during the first year made rapid progress,
which was very gratifying to the family, and secured
for me their good-will and interest. Had I been their nearest
relative I could not have received more respect and consideration
from them. One member of the circle alone seemed to
be entirely indifferent to my presence; this was the brother of
Monsieur D——. Though I had lived in the same house with
him a whole year, and had sat at the same table every day,
scarcely a word had ever passed between us beyond a formal
salutation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The young gentleman was very handsome, and when conversing
with others his manner was extremely fascinating. I
did not believe that I particularly desired his attentions, but
his indifference annoyed me—for I had never before been
treated with such coldness, and I determined to become as
frigid and formal as he could possibly be himself. This
formal acquaintanceship continued for two years, and I persuaded
myself that I had become altogether indifferent to the
presence of my icicle, while at the same time all the other
members of the family increased in their manifestations of
attachment to me.</p>

<p>But trifles often possess a great significance. It was the
custom of the family to get up a little lottery once a week for
the children, if my report of their deportment and progress
was favourable. In this lottery were presents of books, toys,
gloves, and a variety of fancy articles, and among them there
was sure to be a <i lang="fr">bouquet</i> of choice flowers for “Mademoiselle-Miss,”
as they familiarly called me. I knew not positively
whom to thank, although I instinctively felt from whom they
came, for the other members of the family always made me
more useful presents. In time one little attention led to
another, until at the end of three years I found myself the
<i lang="fr">fiancée</i> of the wealthy Constant D——.</p>

<p>Madame D—— was opposed to my marriage with her
brother-in-law, as she desired that he should marry one of
her own wealthy cousins of the old <i lang="fr">noblesse</i> of France. She
treated me, notwithstanding, with great kindness, and confined
her opposition to persuading me not to listen to her brother’s
suit; but finding opposition to his wishes ineffectual, she
finally consented to our engagement, which took place in the
following winter.</p>

<p>From what I observed of the relations which existed between
husbands and wives in France, I did not feel perfectly
happy in the thought of becoming the wife of a Frenchman,
although I dearly loved the French people. Several of my
young lady acquaintances, I knew, had married because it was
fashionable, and especially because it was an emancipation
from what ladies in the higher ranks of society regarded as a
severe social restraint. It was considered shocking for any
young lady to be seen talking to a young gentleman in the
street; indeed it was hardly proper for any unmarried girl to
be seen in the street at all without a <i lang="fr">bonne</i> or some married
lady to accompany her. But immediately she was married
she was at liberty to flirt and promenade with all the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of her acquaintance, while her husband enjoyed the same
liberty among the ladies. This state of affairs did not at all
coincide with my English ideas, for to me the very thought of
marriage was invested with the most sacred obligations, and I
knew I should never be able to bring my mind to accept less
from my husband than I should feel it my duty to render to him.</p>

<p>I loved the French people, and was pleased with their polite
mannerism, but I was not French in character; and though
the prospect before me of an alliance with a wealthy and
noble family was certainly pleasant, and I was greatly attached
to my <i lang="fr">fiancé</i>, my mind was considerably agitated upon the subject
of marriage, as it had before been occupied with religion.</p>

<p>During my sojourn in France I had frequently questioned
myself whether I had not done wrong in remaining absent
for so many years from my home and from communion with
the church of my childhood, and I had always looked forward
to the time when I should return to them again. To this
occasional self-examination was now added another cause of
anxiety, produced by the thought of marriage with a person
of a different faith. Marriage, to me, was the all-important
event in a woman’s life, and some mysterious presentiment
seemed to forewarn me that marriage in <em>my</em> life was to be more
than an ordinary episode—though little did I then dream that
it would have a polygamic shaping.</p>

<p>My young ambition alone had led me to France. I had
aspired to an honourable social position, and had found both it
and also devoted friends. Sometimes I felt that I could not
relinquish what I had gained; at other times I yearned for
the associations of my childhood and the guiding hand of
earlier friends. The conflict in my mind was often painful.
My early prejudices and the teachings of those around me
induced me to believe that the Roman Catholic religion was
entirely wrong; yet, notwithstanding, while living among
Catholics I saw nothing to condemn in their personal lives,
but much to the contrary. In fact, Romanism fascinated me,
while it failed to convince my judgment.</p>

<p>While labouring under these conflicting sentiments, I resolved
to visit my native land, to consult with my parents
about my contemplated marriage; and for that purpose I
asked and obtained two months’ vacation. Surely some mysterious
destiny must have been drawing me to England at
that particular crisis, and before the fulfilling of my engagement,
which would have changed so entirely the whole current
of my existence.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO MORMONISM.</span></h2>

<p>During my residence in France, my parents had left St.
Heliers and returned to Southampton, England. To visit
them now I had to take a sailing vessel from Portrieux to
the Isle of Jersey, and thence I could take the steamer to
Southampton.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame D——, together with the two little
girls, accompanied me in their private carriage to Portrieux,
a distance of forty miles, in order to confide me safely to the
captain’s care. As they wished me “<i lang="fr">bon voyage</i>” and
embraced me affectionately, Mons. D—— handed me a valuable
purse for pocket-money during my absence, and they all
exhibited great anxiety for my welfare, saying over and over
again <i lang="fr">au revoir</i>, as they entered their carriage to return to their
happy home;—thereby implying that this was not a final <i lang="fr">adieu</i>,
but that we should soon meet again.</p>

<p>I cannot tell why it was, but I experienced at that moment
a painful feeling of mental indecision about the future. I
had no real reason to doubt my return to France, and the
certainty of a warm welcome when I should again greet those
dear ones who were now leaving me in tears; but my mind
was troubled by a vague feeling of uncertainty which made
me anything but happy. Filial affection and a sense of duty
drew me towards my parents in England; while a feeling
of gratitude, and, I think, another and more tender sentiment,
turned the current of my thoughts towards the happy home at
St. Brieux.</p>

<p>It was not necessary for me to stop in Jersey for more than a
few hours, but I wanted to revisit the scenes of my childhood’s
happy days, and to speak again with those whom I
had known and loved in early life. In later years the scenes
and memories of childhood seem like the imaginings of a
pleasant dream. A sweet charm is thrown around all that
we then said and did; and the men and women who then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
were known to us are pictured in our recollection as beings
possessing charms and graces such as never belonged to
the common-place children of earth. The glamour of a fairy
wand is over all the past history of mankind; but upon
nothing does it cast so potent a spell as upon the personal
reminiscences of our own infant years. To me that little
island had charms which no stranger could ever have discovered;
and even now, after the lapse of so many long, eventful
years I often feel an earnest wish to visit again those rock-bound
shores, to listen to the everlasting murmur of the wild,
wild waves, to watch the distant speck-like vessels far away
upon the swelling ocean, and to drink in the invigorating
breezes which seem to give life and energy to every pulsation
of the living soul.</p>

<p>But I must not theorize: life has been to me too earnest
and too painful to admit of much sentiment or fancy as I recall
the past. Little as I thought it, during the short visit which
I paid to my birthplace the web of destiny was being woven
for me in a way which I could not then have conjectured even
in a dream.</p>

<p>At St. Heliers I heard for the first time of the Latter-day
Saints, or Mormonites, as they were more familiarly called;
but I cannot express how perfectly astonished I was when I
learned that my father, mother, sisters, and one of my brothers
had been converted to the new faith.</p>

<p>It was my own brother-in-law who told me this. He himself,
with my sister, were “Apostate” Mormons. They had
been baptized into the Mormon Church, but became dissatisfied,
and abandoned it. The St. Heliers branch of the Latter-day
Saints had had a turbulent experience. Their first teachings
had been a mixture of Bible texts about the last days, and
arguments about the millennium, the return of the Jews to
Palestine, the resurrection of the dead, and a new revelation and
a new prophet; but the improper conduct of some of the elders
had disgusted the people with their doctrines, and the tales of
wickedness which I heard were, if true, certainly sufficient to
justify them in rejecting such instructors.</p>

<p>The more I heard of this strange religion the more I was
troubled; yet, as I knew my parents were devoted Christians,
I could hardly believe that Mormonism was such a
vile delusion and imposture as it had been represented to
me, or they would never have accepted it: still it was possible
that they had been led astray by the fascinations of a new
religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>In this state of mind I met in the street the wife of the
Baptist minister whom I have already mentioned. She greeted
me affectionately and then began at once to warn me against
the Latter-day Saints. I inquired what she knew of them;
and she replied that personally she knew nothing, but she
believed them to be servants of the Evil One, adding, “There
is a strange power with them that fascinates the people and
draws them into their meshes in spite of themselves. Let me
entreat you not to go near them. Do not trust yourself
at one of their meetings, or the delusion will take hold of <em>you</em>
too.”</p>

<p>“I cannot ignore Mormonism in this way,” I said, “or pass
it by with indifference; for my parents whom I tenderly love
have been blinded by this delusion, and I can do no less than investigate
its teachings thoroughly, and if I find it false, expose its
errors, and, if possible, save my father’s family from ruin.”</p>

<p>She was not convinced that this was the wisest course for
me to pursue, but I resolved at once to attend a meeting of
the Saints and judge for myself. My brother-in-law, when
he heard of my intentions, tried to dissuade me, but, finding
me determined, finally offered to escort me to the meeting-place.</p>

<p>What I heard on this occasion made a great impression on
my mind, and set me thinking as I had never thought before.
On returning to my sister’s house she asked me what opinion I
had now formed of the Latter-day Saints. I replied that I had
not yet formed any conclusion, but that what I had heard had
given me serious cause for reflection. “Oh,” she said, “you
have caught the Mormon fever, I see.”</p>

<p>I felt a disposition to resent this implication, but I was half
afraid that, after all, my sister was right. Much that I had
heard could, I knew, be proved true from Scripture; and the
rest seemed to me to be capable of demonstration from the
same authority. I resolved, however, to fortify myself against
a too easy credulity, and thought that probably if I heard
more of these doctrines I might be able to discover their
falsity.</p>

<p>On the following day, the elder who had preached at the
meeting, and who, by the way, is one of the present proprietors
of the Salt Lake <cite>Herald</cite>, called to see me, as he had been
intimate with my parents before they left the island. I hardly
knew how to be civil to him, though he had done nothing to
offend me, nor had he been the cause of my parents entering
the Mormon Church; but I disliked him solely on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the stories which I had heard about the Mormons. Intending
only to be kind to me, he told me that on the following day he
proposed to take the steamer for Southampton, as he was going
to attend a conference of the Saints in London, and that he
should be pleased to show me any attentions while crossing the
Channel, and would see me safe home in England. I confess
I really felt insulted at a Mormon Elder offering to be my
escort; and although my trunks were ready packed for my
departure by the same steamer, and Mr. Dunbar knew it, I
thanked him politely, but said I would not go by that boat.
He tried to persuade me to change my mind, and said that I
should have to wait a whole week for another vessel; and at
last I frankly told him the abhorrence I felt at the things I had
heard about the Mormons, and that I should be afraid to travel
in the same steamer with him or any of the Mormon Elders
whom I regarded as no better than so many whited sepulchres.
He, however, very kindly took no offence, for he knew that
I had been listening to those who disliked the Saints. I felt
ashamed at having been betrayed into such unladylike rudeness,
but, notwithstanding, tried to persuade myself that his civility
was, after all, an insult; for I had conceived a detestation of
every Mormon, on account of the deception which I felt sure
had been practised upon my family.</p>

<p>This feeling was not lessened by the consciousness that an
impression had been made upon my own mind. The more in
accordance with Scripture the teaching of the Elders appeared,
the more firmly I believed it must be a powerful delusion.
Here, I said, Satan has indeed taken the form of an angel of
light to deceive, if possible, the very elect.</p>

<p>Elder Dunbar, finding me unyielding, left by the next
steamer, and had a pleasant passage across the Channel, and I
remained on the island another week. During that interval
my mind was haunted with what I had heard of this new
gospel dispensation, as it was called. That angels had again
descended from heaven to teach man upon earth; that a prophet
had been raised up to speak again the mind of the Lord
to the children of men; that the Saints were partakers of the
gifts of the Spirit, as in the Early Christian Church,—all these
assumed facts took the form of reality, and came back into my
mind with greater force every time I strove to drive them
away; just as our thoughts do when we desire to sleep, and
cannot—our very efforts to dismiss them bring them back with
greater force to torment us.</p>

<p>We had an unusually bad passage across the Channel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which annoyed me all the more when I remembered my scornful
refusal to go in the same boat with Elder Dunbar.</p>

<p>On my arrival in Southampton I soon discovered that my
father, mother, and sisters were full of the spirit of Mormonism.
They were rejoicing in it, ardently believing that it was the
fulness of the everlasting gospel, as the Elders styled it; and
whatever I might think of the new religion, I was forced to
confess that it brought into my father’s house peace, love,
kindness, and charity such as were seldom seen in many households
of religious people. My sisters were completely changed
in their manner of life. They cared I nothing for the amusements
which girls of their age usually crave and enjoy. Their
whole thoughts seemed to be occupied with the Church, attending
the meetings of the Saints, and employing every leisure
hour in preparing comforts for the Elders who were travelling
and preaching without purse and scrip. And in all this they
were as happy as children.</p>

<p>Of my parents I might say the same. My dear mother
rejoiced in the belief that she had been peculiarly blessed in
being privileged to live at a time when “the last dispensation”
was revealed; and my father, though an invalid, rejoiced that
he had entered into the kingdom by baptism. Such was the
condition of my father’s house; and who can wonder that,
accustomed as I was to listen with respect to the opinions of
my parents, I was more than ever troubled about the new
religion which they had adopted?</p>

<p>The first Sunday morning that I was in England, my parents
asked me to accompany them to meeting, and I readily complied,
as I wanted to hear more of the strange doctrines which
in some mysterious way had made our family so happy, but
which in other quarters had provoked such bitter hostility. I
know <em>now</em> that this joyousness of heart is not peculiar to new
converts to Mormonism, but may be found among the newly-converted
of every sect which allows the emotional feelings to
come into play. To me, at the time, however, it was a
mystery, but I must confess that the change which had taken
place in those nearest and dearest to me, affecting me personally,
and being so evidently in accordance with the teachings
of the Saviour, led me to regard Mormonism with less
antipathy. The bright side alone of the new faith was presented
to the world abroad; we had yet to go to Utah and
witness the effects of Brigham Young’s teachings at home
before we could know what Mormonism really was.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the trial it was to my pride to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dirty, mean-looking room where the Saints assembled at that
time. No one would rent a respectable hall to them, and they
were glad to obtain the use of any place which was large
enough for their meetings. On the present occasion there was
a very fair gathering of people, who had come together influenced
by the most varied motives. The Presiding Elder—I
should here remark that the word “Elder” has among the
Mormons no reference whatever to age, but is simply a
rank in the priesthood—called the meeting to order, and read
the following hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The morning breaks, the shadows flee;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Lo! Zion’s standard is unfurl’d!</div>
<div class="verse">The dawning of a brighter day</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Majestic rises on the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The clouds of error disappear</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Before the rays of truth divine;</div>
<div class="verse">The glory bursting from afar,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Wide o’er the nations soon will shine!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Gentile fulness now comes in,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And Israel’s blessings are at hand;</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! Judah’s remnant, cleansed from sin,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Shall in the promised Canaan stand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Angels from heaven and truth from earth</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Have met, and both have record borne;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus Zion’s light is bursting forth</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To bring her ransom’d children home.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every word of this hymn had a meaning peculiar to itself,
relating to the distinctive doctrines of the Saints. The congregation
sang with an energy and enthusiasm which made
the room shake again. Self and the outer world were alike forgotten,
and an ecstasy of rapture seemed to possess the souls of
all present. Then all kneeled down, and prayer was offered
for the Prophet, the apostles, high-priests, “seventies,” elders,
priests, teachers, and deacons; blessings were invoked upon
the Saints, and power to convert the Gentiles; and as the
earnest words of supplication left the speaker’s lips, the congregation
shouted a loud “Amen.”</p>

<p>There was no prepared sermon. There never is at a Mormon
meeting. The people are taught that the Holy Ghost
is “mouth, matter, and wisdom.” Whatever the preaching
Elder may say is supposed to come directly by inspiration from
heaven, and the Saints listening, as they believe, not to his
utterances but to the words of God Himself, have nothing to
do but to hear and obey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The first speaker on this occasion was a young gentleman
of respectable family, who had been recently baptized and
ordained. He, too, was from St. Heliers, and I had known
him from childhood. His address impressed me very much.
He had been a member of the Baptist church, and he related
his experience, told how often he had wondered why there
were not inspired men to preach the glad tidings of salvation to
the world to-day, as there were eighteen centuries ago. He
spoke of the joy which he had experienced in being baptized
into the Mormon Church and realizing that he had
received the “gift of the Holy Ghost.” The simplicity with
which he spoke, his evident honesty, and the sacrifice he had
made in leaving the respectable Baptists and joining the despised
Mormons, were, I thought, so many evidences of his
sincerity.</p>

<p>Alas! how little could that young preacher conjecture how
different the practical Mormonism in Utah was from the
theoretical Mormonism which he had learned to believe in
Europe, before polygamy was known among the Saints. A
short time afterwards he gave up his business, married an
accomplished young lady, and went with her to Salt Lake
City. There they were soon utterly disgusted with what they
witnessed, apostatized, and set out for England. When they
had gone three-fourths of their way back to the Missouri
river, the young man, his wife, child, and another apostate
and his wife, were killed by “Indians:”—such, at least, was
the report; but dissenting Mormons have always charged
their “taking off” to the order of the leaders of the Mormon
Church.</p>

<p>But to return to the meeting. The reader must please forgive
me if I dwell a little upon the events of that particular
morning, for naturally they made a deep impression upon my
own mind—it was there that I saw for the first time my husband
who was to be.</p>

<p>I had heard a good deal about a certain Elder, from my
family and from the Saints who visited at our house. They
spoke with great enthusiasm of the earnestness with which he
preached, of the effect which his addresses produced, and
of his confidence in the final triumph of “the kingdom.”</p>

<p>At that time—the summer of 1849—although the branch
of the Mormon Church in Britain was in a most flourishing
condition, there were not in England more than two or three
American Elders preaching the faith, for when—two years
before the period of which I speak—the Saints left Nauvoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and undertook that most extraordinary exodus across the
plains to the Rocky Mountains, the missionary Elders were all
called home, and the work of proselytizing in Europe was left
entirely to the native Elders. To direct their labours there was
placed over them an American elder named Orson Spencer, a
graduate of Dartmouth University, a scholar and a gentleman—a
man well calculated from his previous Christian education to
give an elevated tone to the teachings of the young English
missionaries.</p>

<p>Mormonism in England then, had no resemblance to the
Mormonism of Utah to-day. The Mormons were then simply
an earnest religious people, in many respects like the Methodists,
especially in their missionary zeal and fervour of spirit. The
Mormon Church abroad was purely a religious institution, and
Mormonism was preached by the Elders as the gospel of
Christianity restored. The Church had no political shaping
nor the remotest antagonism to the civil power. The name of
Joseph Smith was seldom spoken, and still more seldom was
heard the name of Brigham Young, and then only so far as they
had reference to the Church of the Saints.</p>

<p>About eighteen months before I visited Southampton, one
of these missionaries had come into that town, “without purse
or scrip.” He was quite a young man and almost penniless,
but he was rich in faith and overflowing with zeal. He knew
no one there; and homeless, and frequently hungry, he continued
his labours. Of fasting he knew much, of feasting
nothing. He first preached under the branches of a spreading
beech-tree in a public park, and when more favoured he
held forth in a school-room or public hall. He had come to
convert the people to Mormonism, or he was going to die
among them; and before such zeal and determination, discouragements,
of course, soon vanished away. He troubled
the ministers of other dissenting churches when they found
him distributing tracts and talking to their people. He was
sowing broadcast dissatisfaction and discontent wherever he
could get any one to listen to him, and thus he drew down
upon himself the eloquence of the dissenting pulpits and the
derision of the local press. But the more they attacked him
the more zealously did he labour, and defied his opponents to
public discussion. Mormonism was bold then in Europe—it
had no American history to meet in those days.</p>

<p>This, and a great deal more, I had heard discussed in glowing
language by my relatives and friends; and thus the young missionary—Elder
Stenhouse—was, by name, no stranger to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Elder Stenhouse who now addressed the meeting,
and I listened to him with attention. The reader must
remember that at that time polygamy was unheard of as a
doctrine of the Saints, and the blood-atonement, the doctrine
that Adam is God, together with the polytheism and priestly
theocracy of after-years, were things undreamed of. The
saving love of Christ, the glory and fulness of the everlasting
Gospel, the gifts and graces of the Spirit, together with repentance,
baptism, and faith, were the points upon which the
Mormon teachers touched; and who can wonder that with such
topics as these, and fortifying every statement with powerful
and numerous texts of Scripture, they should captivate the
minds of religiously inclined people? However this may be,
I can only confess that, as I listened to Elder Stenhouse’s
earnest discourse, I felt my antipathy to Mormonism rapidly
melting away.</p>

<p>At the close of the service, when he left the platform, he
was warmly received by the brethren and sisters, for so the
Saints speak of one another, and they came about him to
shake hands, or it might be to seize the opportunity of slipping
a trifle into his hand to help him in his work. Young
and old, the poor and their more wealthy neighbours, mingled
together like one happy family. It was altogether a most
pleasing scene; and, whatever explanation may yet be given to
Mormonism in America, one thing I know—the facts of its
early history in Europe are among the most pleasant reminiscences
of my life.</p>

<p>Elder Stenhouse came up in a familiar and open-hearted
way to my mother and sisters, and I was introduced to him
as “the other daughter from France.” He kindly welcomed
me, and when I frankly told him the state of my mind, he
made, I must admit, a successful attempt to solve my doubts,
and when I left the meeting it was with sentiments towards
the Saints and their religion far different from those which I
entertained when I entered.</p>

<p>This meeting was a memorable era in my life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE LABOUR OF MY LIFE BEGUN:—HOW THE MORMON
MISSIONARIES MADE CONVERTS.</span></h2>

<p>In the afternoon I attended a meeting of a still more interesting
character. These Sunday afternoon meetings were held
for the purpose of receiving the sacrament, and the confirmation
of those who had been baptized during the week; they
were intended exclusively for the Saints, but for certain
reasons I was permitted to be present.</p>

<p>The meeting was opened with singing and prayer, and then
the presiding Elder—Brother Cowdy—arose, and invited all
those who had been baptized during the week to come to the
front seats. Several ladies and gentlemen came forward, and
also three little children. Upon inquiry I found that children
of eight years of age were admitted members of the Church
by baptism—which is administered by immersion. At that
age they are supposed to understand what they are doing; but
before that, if of Mormon parents, they are considered members
of the Church by virtue of the blessing which they
received in infancy. Brother Cowdy—the presiding’ Elder—then
called upon two other Elders to assist him in the confirmation.</p>

<p>One of the ladies took off her bonnet, but retained her seat,
when all three of the Elders placed their hands upon her head,
and one of them said:—</p>

<p>“Martha; by virtue of the authority vested in us, we confirm
you a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints; and as you have been obedient to the teachings of the
Elders, and have gone down into the waters of baptism for the
remission of your sins, we confer upon you the Gift of the
Holy Ghost, that it may abide with you for ever, and be a
lamp unto your feet, and a light upon your pathway, leading
and guiding you into all truth. This blessing we confirm upon
your head, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost. Amen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, before they took their hands off her head, the presiding
Elder asked the other two if they wished to say anything.
Whereupon one of them began to invoke a blessing upon the
newly-confirmed sister. He spoke for some time with extreme
earnestness, when suddenly he was seized with a nervous trembling
which was quite perceptible, and which evidently betokened
intense mental or physical excitement. He began to prophecy
great things for this sister in the future, and in solemn and
mysterious language proclaimed the wonders which God
would perform for her sake. When we consider the excited
state of her mind, and—if the statements of psychologists
be true—the magnetic currents which were being transmitted
from the sensitive nature of the man into the excited
brain of the new convert, together with the pressure of half a
dozen human hands upon her head, it is not at all astonishing
that when the hands were lifted off she should firmly
believe that she had been blessed indeed. She had been told
that she should receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost; and
she did not for an instant doubt that her expectations had
been realized.</p>

<p>Each of the newly-baptized went through the same ceremony,
and then they all partook of the sacrament, when, after another
hymn, the meeting was closed with prayer.</p>

<p>In the evening I returned, to listen to a lecture upon “the
character, spirit, and genius” of the new church, delivered by
Elder Stenhouse; and I was captivated by the picture which
he drew of the marvellous latter-day work which he affirmed
had already begun. The visions of by-gone ages were again
vouchsafed to men; angels had visibly descended to earth;
God had raised up in a mighty way a Prophet, as of old, to
preach the dispensation of the last days; gifts of prophecy,
healing, and the working of miracles were now, as in the days
of the Apostles, witnesses to the power of God. The long-lost
tribes of Israel were about to be gathered into the one
great fold of Christ; and the fulness of the Gentiles being
come, they, too, were to be taken under the care of the Good
Shepherd. All were freely invited to come and cast away
their sins, ere it was too late; and the fullest offers of pardon,
grace, sanctification, and blessing, in this world and in the next,
were presented to every repentant soul.</p>

<p>Surely, I thought, these are the self-same doctrines which
my mother taught me, when I knelt beside her in childhood,
and which I have so often heard—only in colder and less persuasive
language—urged from the pulpits of those whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have ever regarded in the light of true disciples of Jesus.
Who can wonder that I listened with rapt attention, and that
my heart was even then half won to the new faith? The
days passed; and as I pondered over these things it appeared
to me that I had at last found that which I had so long earnestly
desired and prayed for—a knowledge of that true religion
for which the Saviour presented Himself a Holy Sacrifice, and
which the Apostles preached at peril of their lives—the <em>only</em>
faith, in which I might find joy and peace in believing.</p>

<p>But why should I dwell upon those moments, soul-absorbing
as was their interest to me <em>then</em>—sadly-pleasing as is their
memory <em>now</em>! The reader can see the drift of my thoughts
at that time; and I feel sure, although I have but hastily
sketched the causes which brought about these great changes
in my religious belief and in my life, that he will not hastily
accuse me of fickleness and love of change, if he himself has
fought the battles of the soul, and has learned even in a slight
measure to realize the mystery of his inner being.</p>

<p>Each day the finger of destiny drew me nearer to the final
step. The young Elder, whose words I had listened to with
such strange and, to me, momentous results, was intimate with
my father’s family, and called frequently to see us, and before
long he convinced me that it was my duty to test for myself
whether the work was of God, or not. In the agitated state
of my mind at that time, I could not withstand the earnest
appeals which were made to my affections and hopes; and
within two weeks after my arrival in England I became
formally a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints; or in more popular language—I became a Mormon.</p>

<p>The day was fixed for my baptism. Several others were to
be baptized at the same time; for scarcely a week passed
without quite a number of persons joining the Church. For
this purpose we all repaired to a bath-house on the banks of the
Southampton river. This place was not perhaps the most
convenient, and it certainly was devoid of the slightest tinge
of romance; but it was the only one available to the saints at
that time.</p>

<p>When we were all assembled and had united in singing and
prayer, Elder Stenhouse went down into the water first, and
then two men went down and were baptized, and came up
again. Now came my turn. I was greatly agitated, for I felt
all the solemnity of the occasion. I had dressed myself very
neatly and purely, for I believed that angel eyes were upon me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
I wished to give myself—a perfect and acceptable offering—to
my God, and I was filled with the determination henceforth to
devote my whole life to His service.</p>

<p>As I went down into the waters of baptism, how thankful I
felt that it had been my privilege to hear the gospel in my
youth, for now I could give my heart in all its freshness to the
Lord, before it had been chilled by the cold, hard experience
of life.</p>

<p>I descended the steps, and Elder Stenhouse came forward
and led me out into the water; then, taking both my hands in
one of his, he raised his other hand towards heaven, and in a
solemn and impressive voice he said,—</p>

<p>“<em>Fanny; by virtue of the authority vested in me, I baptize
you for the remission of your sins; in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</em>”</p>

<p>Then he immersed me in the water; and as I reascended
the steps, I really felt like another being: all my past was
buried in the deep—the waters of baptism had washed away
my sins; and a new life lay open before me, in which my footsteps
would be guided by the inspired servants of God. All
now would be peace and joy within me, for I had obeyed the
commands of God, and I doubted not that I should receive the
promised blessing, and that now I could indeed go on my way
rejoicing.</p>

<p>My baptism took place one Saturday afternoon, and the
afternoon following I was confirmed a member of the Church.
Elder Stenhouse presided at the meeting, and he, with Elder
Cowdy, and two other elders, confirmed me. As the “blessing”
which I then myself received differs somewhat from the
one which I have already given, and as it is a very fair specimen
of those effusions, I present it to the reader in full.</p>

<p>Elder Stenhouse, Elder Cowdy, and the two other Elders,
placed their hands solemnly upon my head, and Elder Stenhouse
said,—</p>

<p>“Fanny; by virtue of the authority vested in me, I confirm
you a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints; and inasmuch as you have been obedient to the command
of God, through his servants, and have been baptized
for the remission of your sins, I say unto you that those sins
are remitted. And in the name of God I bless you, and say
unto you, that inasmuch as you are faithful and obedient to the
teachings of the priesthood, and seek the advancement of the
kingdom, there is no good thing that your heart can desire
that the Lord will not give unto you. You shall have visions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and dreams, and angels shall visit you by day and by night.
You shall stand in the temple in Zion, and administer to the
Saints of the Most High God. You shall speak in tongues,
and prophecy; and the Lord shall bless you abundantly, both
temporally and spiritually. These blessings I seal upon your
head, inasmuch as you shall be faithful; and I pray heaven
to bless you; and say unto you—<em>Be thou blessed</em>, in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.”</p>

<p>After the meeting, I received the congratulations of all the
Saints present, and more particularly those of my own family.
My dear mother and father were overjoyed; and I now learned
how anxious they had been, and how they had feared that I
should return to France and reject the faith of the new dispensation.
Altogether we were very happy.</p>

<p>Elder Stenhouse and Elder Cowdy returned home with us
to tea, and afterwards we all attended the usual evening
lecture. In this way was passed one of the happiest days of
my life—one which I shall ever remember;—and yet that
memory will always be mingled with regret that so much love
and devotion as I then felt were not enlisted in a better cause.</p>

<p>Thus began a new era in my life. All my former friends
and associations were now to be remembered no more; my
lot was cast among the Saints; and in the state of my mind
at that time, I believed that I should be happy in my new
position, and resolved to give evidence of the sincerity of my
faith.</p>

<p>The untiring energy and restless activity of Elder Stenhouse
was ever before our eyes, and inspired all who associated
with him with a similar enthusiasm. There were no
drones in that hive. The brethren, at a word from him,
would roam the country, teaching and preaching in the open
air, while the sisters would go from house to house in the
city, distributing tracts about the new faith. I caught the
enthusiasm of the rest, and was soon in the ranks with the
other sisters, as devoted in my endeavours as a young, ambitious
heart could be. I was indeed like one born again from an old
existence into a new life. I felt grateful and happy—I began
to dream of the eternal honour which crowns a faithful missionary
life; and I soon found an ample field for testing my
fitness for that vocation.</p>

<p>At the time of which I speak, the Primitive Methodists in
England were doing a great work in the way of converting
sinners. Their missionaries were zealous and devoted men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
though generally poor and uneducated. They resembled very
closely the Mormon elders in their labours; and, in fact, a very
large number of the leading Mormons had been Methodist
local-preachers and exhorters; and the greater number of the
new-born Saints had come from that denomination with their
former teachers, or else had followed them soon after.</p>

<p>The change from Methodist to Mormon was, in course of
time, very strongly marked; but for a considerable period the
same, or what seemed the same, influences were at work
among the people. Remarkable scenes of excitement were
often witnessed at the “love feasts;” and from the “anxious
seats,” as they were called, might be heard, the entreaties of
self-accusing souls, frightened by a multitude of sins, crying
earnestly, nay, wildly, for grace, mercy, and the Holy Ghost;
while many of the supplicants would fall upon the ground,
completely overcome by nervous excitement. Then they
would have visions, and beheld great and unutterable things;
received the forgiveness of their sins; and, coming back to
consciousness, believed themselves now to be the children of
God, and new creatures; doubting not that they would ever
after be happy in the Lord.</p>

<p>The experience of the Saints at their meetings, when
Mormonism was first preached, was exactly similar to this.
Into the psychological, moral, or religious causes of these
scenes of excitement I cannot here enter;—I simply mention
facts as they came under my own observation.</p>

<p>The Mormon Missionary often came upon whole communities
in the rural districts of England, where this “good time”
was in full operation; and being a man of texts he would
follow up the revival, preaching that the spirit of the prophet
was subject to the prophet, and not the prophet subject to the
spirit. Controversy would arise, and his appeal to Scripture,
literally interpreted, was almost invariably triumphant. Even
in America, especially in New York and Ohio, the same
causes produced the same effects. It was after his mind was
excited by a general revival near his native place, that Joseph
Smith, the founder of Mormonism, received his first religious
impression, and saw, as he asserted, his first angelic vision.
His followers, even in the early days of the Church, had
revival-meetings and meetings at which the most extraordinary
excitement was manifested,—when the Saints fell into
ecstatic trances, saw heaven opened, and spake with tongues.
But Joseph, shrewd man as he was, albeit “a prophet,” when
he found too many rival seers were coming into the field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
announced by “special revelation,” that these too-gifted persons
were possessed by devils, and that their visions and
prophesyings must be at once suppressed. And he did suppress
them.</p>

<p>Not long after my own baptism I was present at a meeting
of this description, in Southampton. It was called a “testimony
meeting,” and was held in a large upper room situated,
if I rightly remember, in Chandos Street. No one from the
outside would have supposed that it was the place of assembly
of the Saints, for it was generally used for ordinary secular
meetings, and I have heard that great objections were at first
raised as to the propriety of letting it to the Mormons.</p>

<p>As we entered the door, we were saluted by Brother
Williams, who expressed great pleasure at seeing us. There
was a full attendance of the Saints, and every face wore an
expression of peaceful earnestness. A person who has never
attended a Mormon meeting can form no idea of the joyous
spirit which seemed to animate every one present. I am not,
of course, speaking of modern meetings, but of meetings as
they used to be. Whence and whatever that “spirit” might
be which moved the sisters and brethren when they met in
early times, I cannot tell; but I, and with me, ten thousand
Mormons and seceding Mormons in Utah, can, from our own
experience, testify that <em>that</em> spirit no longer visits the Tabernacle
services over which Brigham Young presides, or the
meetings of the Saints since they adopted the accursed doctrine
of polygamy, and forsook the gentle leadings of their
first love.</p>

<p>Often have I heard Mormons of good standing and high
position in the Church, lament the “good old times” as they
called them, when the outpouring of the Spirit was so abundant,
and mourn over the cold, barren services of the present
day. But the elders explain this away. It is, they say, the
fault of the people themselves, and because their own hearts
have become cold.</p>

<p>At the meeting of which I speak, that happy spirit was
peculiarly marked. An encouraging smile, or a kind word,
greeted me on every side, and, as a newly-converted sister, I
received the most cordial welcome. The brethren were seated
on forms and chairs and any other convenient article which
came to hand, while at the further end of the room was
Brother Bench, who was to preside, and with him several
other leading Elders. Brother Bench gave out a suitable
hymn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole congregation joined in the singing, and every
heart seemed lifted up with devotion. Then another Elder
rose, and offered a spirit-moving prayer; and then the brother
who presided stated that for the time he withdrew his control
of the proceedings, and, as the phrase was, he “put the meeting
in the hands of the Saints,” exhorting them not to let the
time pass by unimproved.</p>

<p>Then arose Brother Edwards, a well-tried champion of the
faith, and to him every one listened with profound attention,
eagerly drinking in his every utterance. I could almost, even
now, imagine that he was really inspired. <em>Then</em> I firmly
believed he was. His voice thrilled with an earnestness which
seemed to us something more than the mere excitement of
the soul. A burning fire seemed to flash from his large,
expressive eyes; his features were lighted up with that
animation which gives a saint-like halo to the earnest face
when fired with indignation or pleading soul-felt truths; while
his whole frame seemed to glow with the glory of a land
beyond this earth, as in the most impressive and convincing
language he reminded us that our sins had been washed away
by the waters of baptism, that upon us had been poured the
gifts and graces of the Spirit, and that it was our sacred privilege
to testify of these things.</p>

<p>The effect of this exhortation was magical. We forgot all
our outward surroundings, in the realization that the great
work of the Lord was so gloriously begun, and that it would
surely go on, conquering and to conquer. One sister—an
elderly woman—who was present, unable to control her emotion,
burst out with that Mormon hymn which I have heard
some old Nauvoo Saints declare produced upon the people
in those days an enthusiasm similar to that which moves the
heart of every true Frenchman when he listens to the soul-stirring
notes of the Marseillaise:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Spirit of God like a fire is burning!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The latter day glory begins to come forth;</div>
<div class="verse">The visions and blessings of old are returning,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The angels are coming to visit the earth.</div>
<div class="verse">We’ll sing and we’ll shout with the armies of heaven,</div>

<div class="verse indent1">Henceforth and for ever: Amen, and Amen.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have often heard in magnificent cathedrals, hoary with
the dust of time, and in vast places of amusement dedicated
specially to music and to song, the outpouring of that glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
vocal flood, which a chorus of a thousand well-trained singers
can alone send forth. I have felt sometimes that entrancing
state of ecstasy which thrilled the soul of the seer in Patmos,
as he listened to the melody of the angelic throng—“the
voice of many waters, and the peal of mighty thunders, and
the notes of harpers harping upon their harps;” but never,
even when surrounded by all that was best calculated to
produce a sentiment of devotion in my mind—never did I
experience so rapt a feeling of communion with “the armies
of heaven”—as I felt in that unadorned meeting-room, surrounded
by those plain but earnest and united people.</p>

<p>Nor was I alone in this. The feeling was contagious.
There was not one present who did not sympathize. And
thus, I suppose, melody has always played a prominent part
in all religious revivals, whether of divine or human origin.
The Apostles had their psalms, and hymns, and spiritual
songs; the Martyrs their <cite>Te Deum</cite>; the Waldenses made the
hills and vales of Piedmont vocal with their singing; the
Lollards and Hussites had their melodies; and in more
modern days the followers of Luther, Wesley, and (may I
add?) Joseph Smith, have poured out the fulness of their
souls after the same fashion.</p>

<p>The last notes of the hymn had scarcely died away when
another, and then another brother, arose and bore testimony
to the great work, told what the Lord had done for them
personally, told of their zeal for the faith, and fervently exhorted
all present to persevere unto the end. Again prayer
was offered, another hymn sung, and the Saints were dismissed
with a solemn benediction.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">LIFE AMONG THE SAINTS—MY NEW ENGAGEMENTS.</span></h2>

<p>I was now a Mormon in every sense of the word, although
entirely ignorant of Utah politics and polygamy.</p>

<p>My dreams were of a life of happiness spent in seeking to
convert the whole world to the religion of Jesus, which I believed
had been restored again to earth by the ministry of
holy angels. It is easy to say that such an ambition was ill-directed
when associated with Mormonism, but no one can
deny that, in itself, it was the noblest and purest that could
inspire the heart of man. There was no sacrifice too great
for me to make; there was no object too dear for me to resign,
if it stood in the way of my sacred calling. The whole
current of my thoughts and plans was now changed. It was
henceforth my duty to be entirely forgetful of self, and to devote
my energies—my all—to the advancement of the Kingdom
of God. My life was to be identified with the Saints,—my
faith required it, and I was willing that it should be so.</p>

<p>But what of my beloved France, all this time; and my betrothed
husband?</p>

<p>This reflection aroused within me a most painful train of
thought. How many fond and endearing memories entwined
themselves around my heart at that moment, when most I
needed to banish them for ever! With what lingering love
did I look back to those dear ones from whom I had parted
but a few short weeks before, and whom I might perhaps never
see again! To return would be to desert my newly-adopted
friends and faith—to violate the covenant which I had made
at baptism to “be ever afterwards governed by the servants
of God.”</p>

<p>No; it was too late—I could not now return;—I tried to
persuade myself that I did not even wish to;—in a word,
affection, and what I thought duty, were at war together in
my heart. All my former ties and associations must now be
severed, however terrible the cost might be; and I was bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
not only to submit, but even to glory in the sacrifice. Thus
I argued away the regrets which would at times agitate my
very soul, and cause me much painful thought.</p>

<p>The trial of my profession in the new faith came swiftly to
my door. My marriage-engagement must be broken off,
though I knew not how that could honourably and conscientiously
be done. Of myself I had no wish to draw back from
anything that I had promised of my own free will; and much
less did I desire to be faithless to my solemnly plighted
word.</p>

<p>I now first realized the all-absorbing influence of an earnest
religious faith. I was brought face to face with the fact that
I could not marry out of the Mormon Church. The teaching
of the Elders was against it, and I saw that in this they were
consistent. Great as was the trial, and painful as was the
sacrifice, I resolved to be true to my religion. How very
earnestly the Elders insisted upon such sacrifices, may be seen
from an appeal made at a later date by the “Apostle” Orson
Pratt. Brother Orson was in Europe, and, speaking authoritatively,
he set forth the duties of mothers and daughters in
“Babylon,” as he graciously styled the rest of the world, in
the following terms, which unmistakably show the purposes of
the leaders relative to marriage:—</p>

<p>“Many of you have daughters, some of whom are grown to
womanhood; others are now young. Would, you have them
gather with you to a land where virtue and peace dwell, where
God has promised to protect and bless the righteous? If so,
teach them, as they love their parents, and the Saints, and the
truth, not to throw themselves away by marrying Gentiles;
teach them to <em>keep themselves entirely aloof from Gentile</em>
courtships and associations. Scores of women who once were
counselled as you are now, are mourning in wretchedness, in
bondage to Gentile husbands, cut off from all privilege of
gathering with their fathers, mothers, brethren, and sisters;
and, in some instances, cut off from even attending the Saints’
meetings. But this is not all. They are raising up children
in these lands to perish with themselves in the general desolations
coming upon Babylon. But what is still more aggravating
and heart-rending, they are raising up children not
only destined for temporal judgments, but who must for ever
be cut off from the presence of God and the glory of the
celestial kingdom.... What fearful responsibility
for any young sister to voluntarily take upon herself,
after all the warnings she has received. See to it, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
parents, that you not only do not give your consent, but actually
forbid all such marriages....</p>

<p>“<em>Let them marry according to the holy order of God</em>, and
begin to lay the foundation of a little family kingdom which
shall no more be scattered upon the face of the earth, but
dwell in one country, keeping their genealogies from generation
to generation, until each man’s house shall be multiplied
as the stars of heaven.”</p>

<p>These were the influences which were brought to bear upon
my mind at a time when it was peculiarly sensitive, and open
to impressions from without.</p>

<p>While in this uncertain state a little incident occurred which,
though in itself of the most trifling nature, assisted in forming
my ultimate decision.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening in early summer, and my mother
and sister asked me to accompany them to one of the testimony-meetings
which I have already described. This meeting
was very similar to the others, with one notable exception:—it
was here that I saw and heard, for the first time in my
own experience, the “gift of tongues” exercised.</p>

<p>Long before I had even heard of Mormonism, I had frequently
thought how wonderfully useful this gift must have been
to the Apostles. One of the great difficulties encountered by the
missionary is learning the language of the people among whom
he works and lives. To be able to dispense with all this
labour, and to be understood wherever he went, must have
lightened the mind of the holy man of half its load; and
naturally, when I heard that the Mormons had “the Gift of
Tongues,” I supposed it was the self-same power of diverse
speech as that exercised by the Apostles; and I presume the
reader will conjecture with me that it was the same “gift,” or,
at least, some imitation of it. How surprised I was when I
first discovered the meaning of the term “speaking in tongues”
among the Mormons, may perhaps be imagined when I explain
what happened at that testimony-meeting.</p>

<p>After prayer, and singing, and listening to several very
fervent addresses from some of the elders, Brother Seely
had delivered a most impassioned speech, and had hardly
concluded, when Sister Ellis, who was sitting near me, gave
evidence of being in an abnormal condition of mind, which to
me was painful in the extreme. Her hands were clenched,
and her eyes had that wild and supernatural glare which is
never seen, save in cases of lunacy or intense feverish excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Every one waited breathlessly, listening to catch what
she might say;—you might have heard a pin drop.</p>

<p>Then in oracular language and with all the impassioned
dignity of one inspired of heaven, she began to speak.</p>

<p>I say “speak,” as that term is generally applied to the
utterances of the human voice; but she did not <em>speak</em> in the
sense in which we always employ that word; she simply
emitted a series of sounds. They seemed to me chiefly the
repetition of the same syllables—something like a child repeating,
<i>la, la, la, le, lo</i>; <i>ma, ma, ma, mi, ma</i>; <i>dele, dele, dele,
dela</i>—followed, perhaps, by a number of sounds strung together,
which could not be rendered in <em>any</em> shape by the pen.
Sometimes in the Far West, in later years, I have heard old
Indian women, crooning weirdly monotonous and outlandish
ditties in their native tongue. These wild dirges, more nearly
than anything else I ever heard, resembled the prophetic
utterances of Sister Ellis; save only, that the appearance of
the latter was far too solemn to admit of even a smile at what
she said.</p>

<p>Ridiculous as this appears when I now write it down on
paper, and strange as even then it was to me, there was something
so commanding, so earnest, so “inspirational,” if I may
be allowed the term, in Sister Ellis’s manner, that I could not
wonder at the attention which the brethren and sisters paid
to this gifted speaker in tongues.</p>

<p>I now know that these extraordinary displays are by no
means confined to Mormonism. People of a certain temperament,
excited to frenzy—generally by religious enthusiasm—have
in all ages given painful illustrations of this mental
disease; as the student who remembers the <i lang="fr">Convulsionnaires</i>
of the middle ages, the Munster Anabaptists of Luther’s time,
and the various emotional sects of more modern days, will
abundantly bear me witness. But at that time, new in the
faith, and believing as I did that, as the Elders said, it was
the manifestion of the power of God, as foretold by the
prophet Joel, though I secretly felt a sense of repugnance, I
tried to combat my better sentiments.</p>

<p>Overcome by the excitement of the moment, Sister Ellis
suddenly paused, not so much intentionally as from sheer
inability to proceed; and the leading Elders looked round
from one to another to see if any one was present who could
interpret. The gift of interpretation is very rarely possessed
by the same person who has the gift of tongues, and you may
often hear one after another arise and “speak,” but there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
no one to “interpret,” and the Saints go away unedified.
Even when an interpreter is present, there is no authority to
determine whether he gives the proper rendering of the
sounds uttered, and I have over and over again heard the
most ludicrous stories of the comical interpretation placed by
some half-witty or half-witted expounder upon these oracles.</p>

<p>When Brother Brigham—then a man who was lowly in his
own eyes—first met the prophet Joseph Smith, at Kirtland,
Ohio, there was a scene somewhat like the one I have described;
and the future leader of “this people,” as he calls
the Saints, himself spake with tongues and uttered wonderful
things. But even supposing his words at that time to have
been of the wisest, we all know from the example of Balaam’s
<em>reprover</em>, that it does not require a very high order of intellect
to speak in unaccustomed language—and that, too, to some
purpose. In later days the exercise of this gift has been discouraged
by the Elders, and especially by Brigham Young.
Going one day, some years after, to the Lion-House to see a
certain member of the Prophet’s little family concerning a
subject which lay very near to my heart at that time, we
prayed together earnestly and anxiously; when suddenly the
lady’s face was lighted up with a supernatural glow, and
placing her hand on my head she, sibyl-like, poured forth a
flood of eloquence which—although I did not understand a
single word that was uttered—I confess sent through me a
magnetic thrill as if I had been listening to an inspired
seeress. Another of Brigham’s wives who was present interpreted
the words of blessing to me, but added: “Do not
speak of this, Sister Stenhouse, for Brother Young does not
like to hear of these things.” Thus we see that one inspired
prophet in the presence of another “prophet, seer, and revelator,”
could himself take part at one time in a miraculous
manifestation, which in later years he “would not like to hear
of,” if it was only one of his many wives who enacted the
prophet’s <i lang="fr">rôle</i>.</p>

<p>But my meeting! I have wandered far away from that.
Let me proceed.</p>

<p>After more testimony, more “speaking,” and much enthusiasm,
the Saints separated. My sister was talking with a
young-lady friend, and regretting that no one present had
been able to interpret; and I stood by, but did not join in the
conversation. Suddenly the young lady turned to me and
said: “Sister Fanny, do you not see in all this, more and
more, the convincing power of God?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Rather hesitatingly I replied, “Yes, I think I do.”</p>

<p>“<em>Think!</em> sister?” said she, with warmth. “Oh, yes, I
see by your looks that you are only half convinced; your faith
is not strong enough yet; but remember, whatsoever is of
doubt <em>is sin</em>!”</p>

<p>“But,” I answered, “I do not see clearly what good we
receive from these manifestations when no one can understand
them.”</p>

<p>“That is your want of faith—nothing else; you have the
evidence of the truth before you, and you see how these
miraculous powers build up the belief of God’s people; and
yet you doubt. <em>To doubt is sin</em>: whatsoever is not of faith is
sin. You must pray and strive, sister, to be strengthened
against temptation.”</p>

<p>All this was not very logical, and it certainly did not help
to dispel my doubts. But twice in the course of a few short
sentences, she had used a certain expression which, though
trifling in itself, was recalled to my mind very forcibly before
many days had passed.</p>

<p>This was my first experience of speaking in tongues.</p>

<p>But there were every-day matters of much more real importance
to me than those strange speculations which had
recently employed so much of my time and attention. It was
now necessary that I should either return to France and fulfil
my engagement with Monsieur D—— or else resolve, once and
for ever, to renounce all those ties which had become so dear
to me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, religious theories were not the only influences
brought to bear upon my mind.</p>

<p>While day by day I began to be still more doubtful whether
it would not after all be sinful in God’s sight for me to leave
my friends in the new faith and go back to France and my
betrothed, who I knew neither was nor ever could become a
Saint, other thoughts began to intrude themselves, and to
shake my determination.</p>

<p>Elder Stenhouse’s visits to my father’s house began to be
more frequent than ever, but as he desired to become familiar
with the French language, and would bring his French grammar
with him “to get a lesson,” as he said, no particular notice
was taken of his frequent coming. He was always welcomed
with pleasure by the whole family, and, of course, by myself,
who was his teacher. After awhile he took so much delight
in his studies that he could not endure to let an evening pass
without a lesson; and somehow or other, I must confess, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was the first time since I had been a teacher that I felt such a
peculiar pleasure in imparting instruction. I suppose it was
the interest which all teachers experience when their pupils
are studiously inclined. My pupil was particularly studious—so
much so that he told my father and mother that he could not
study very well in the parlour where every one was conversing,
and begged the privilege of having the folding doors thrown
partly open, that we might sit in the back parlour and be more
quiet.</p>

<p>This was granted. But after a few evenings my pupil took
a notion to partly close the folding doors after him, and, as
mother’s eyes are ever watchful, one of my sisters was sent
in with her sewing to keep us company. But my pupil by
this time had made rapid progress in the French language,
and while my sister was innocently sewing, he was repeating
his lesson to me; and it was not our fault if in those French
phrase-books there were passages expressive of love and
devotion. Unconsciously to us both, he formed the habit of
repeating those phrases to me at all times, and I formed the
equally bad habit of blushing whenever he made use of
them.</p>

<p>This my sister observed, and communicated the fact to my
mother, who immediately said that we had better discontinue
our French for awhile, as it was monopolizing too much of
our time, and keeping both of us from attending to other
and more important duties. But the discontinuation of the
French lessons did not put an end to the visits of Elder Stenhouse.
He was a persevering young man; but the secret of
the great interest taken in the French lessons was soon discovered.</p>

<p>Then it was that arguments of all kinds, and strong reasons,
were brought forward to shake my purpose of returning to
France. I was “in doubt;” when one day, discussing the
point, Elder Stenhouse made use of the very same expression
which had fallen from the sister’s lips at the testimony-meeting—“Whatsoever
is not of faith is sin.” My mind unsettled,
with all the strength of argument and religion on the one side,
and on the other no one to plead for reason and for my return
to France, who can wonder that I—at best only a weak and
inexperienced girl—listened to the entreaties of my friends,
and resolved to stay.</p>

<p>In the course of a few months I was engaged to be married
to Elder Stenhouse. It may, perhaps, seem strange that I
could so soon forget the past, with all its pleasant memories and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
renouncing my betrothed husband, accept the attentions of
another; but it should be remembered that I now firmly
believed it was my duty—a duty which I dared not neglect—to
blot out for ever all past associations, however dear to my
heart they might be. Besides which, I, in common with all
around me, had learned to look upon Elder Stenhouse as almost
an angel, on account of what he had endured for the gospel’s
sake; and I thought that any girl might consider herself
honoured by an offer of marriage from a man in his position in
the Church. My marriage in France would, I feared, have been
but doubtful happiness in this world, and certain ruin in the
next; but heaven itself would bless my union with one of its
own ordained and tried servants.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that on the 6th of February, 1850—eight
months after my arrival in Southampton—I was married
to the young Mormon missionary, Elder Stenhouse. I entered
upon my new sphere as a missionary’s wife, feeling that there
were no obstacles so great that I could not overcome them for
the gospel’s sake. How little could I then imagine the life
that was before me!</p>

<p>I wrote to my friends in France. I told them frankly <em>all</em>.
In return they wrote to me—especially Monsieur D——, entreating
me to alter my determination. Kind, and very gentle,
were those letters. Dear, very dear, has been the memory of
them, and of their writers, in later days. But at the time I
felt that the influence which they still retained over me was
in itself a sin.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIRST WHISPERINGS OF POLYGAMY.</span></h2>

<p>About three months after our marriage it was rumoured that
four of the Twelve Apostles had been appointed to foreign
missions, and were then on their way to England.</p>

<p>The Saints in Britain had been for several years without
any missionaries direct from the body of the church, and
the announcement of this foreign mission was hailed with
joy.</p>

<p>I confess to experiencing much pleasure at the thought of
becoming acquainted with a living Apostle. How often in my
girlhood I had wished that I had lived when men inspired of
God walked the earth. What a joy, I thought, it would have
been to have listened to the wisdom of such teachers. Now
the time was near when I should realize all the happiness of
my day-dreams—when I should really have the privilege of
conversing with those chosen men of God. The invitation,
therefore, to meet the Conference in London on the 1st of
June, was very welcome intelligence.</p>

<p>We went to the London Conference—my husband and I;
and there for the first time I met with Apostles, who were also
Prophets, and Priests, and High-priests, and Teachers, and
Elders, and Deacons—all assembled in solemn convocation.</p>

<p>The four Apostles whom I met at that time were John Taylor,
Lorenzo Snow, Erastus Snow, and Franklin D. Richards—pleasant
and agreeable men, and withal very fair specimens
of Mormon missionaries, who had found favour in the eyes of
Brigham Young and of the leaders in Zion, and who had
been promoted accordingly. They lived comfortably, wore
the finest broadcloth, fashionably cut, and were not averse to
gold chains, and charms, and signet-rings, and other personal
adornments. They put on no particular airs, were as polite
and attentive to ladies as gentlemen always are, and could go
to a theatre or any other place of amusement without hesitation.
I afterwards discovered that in one particular, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
if not in all, they resembled the early Apostles, for they too
could, like St. Paul, “lead about a sister” without any compunctions
of conscience.</p>

<p>The Southampton Saints had hitherto formed only a branch
of the London Conference, but did not form a conference of
their own. It was now resolved that since so large a number
had recently been baptized in Hampshire, the several branches
of the church there should be organized into a special conference
at Southampton, with Elder Stenhouse as its president;
and the Sunday following was appointed for that purpose,
when the Apostle Snow, <i lang="fr">en route</i> to Italy—to which country
he had just been appointed missionary—would honour the
occasion with his presence.</p>

<p>As we returned, some gentlemen in the same railway carriage,
to while away the time, I suppose, entered into a religious
discussion. What the subject was I do not now remember;
but I can recollect that a good deal was said as to which
of all the numerous Christian sects really possessed Divine
authority. Elder Stenhouse took an active part in the argument,
and being, like all the Mormon Missionaries at that
time, very well posted in Scriptural discussions, he attracted
considerable attention, and was much complimented by several
persons present.</p>

<p>The Apostle Lorenzo Snow was silent all the time, but he
took note of all that passed. Elder Stenhouse was a man of
great zeal and untiring energy—qualities in which perhaps
Brother Snow felt himself a little deficient; and he was going
on a mission which required unflagging devotion and perseverance.
We had not been an hour at home, before he told
my husband that the Lord had <em>thrice</em> revealed to him that he
should accompany him to Italy! How often—even while I
still clung to Mormonism—did it appear strange to me that
the “revelations” of distinguished Saints should so frequently
coincide with their own personal wishes, and come
at such convenient times.</p>

<p>I had laid aside my travelling-dress, and was hastening to
provide some refreshment for the Apostle, when my husband
came and told me of the revelation which had been so opportunely
received. I was at that time as much an enthusiast as
Elder Stenhouse himself, and I felt honoured that my husband
should be the first English elder appointed to a foreign mission.
Here was the fulfilment of my ambition, that we
should be in the forefront of the battle, and should obtain
distinction as zealous servants of God. But at what a cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was this ambition purchased! My poor, weak heart sickened
at the thought—I had been but four months married.</p>

<p>When the Apostle asked me if I were willing that Elder
Stenhouse should go to Italy, I answered “Yes,” though I
felt as if my heart would break. I remembered that in my
first transport of joy and gratitude after being baptized, I had
made a covenant with the Lord that I would do anything
which He might require of me; and I dared not rebel, or break
that vow. Oh, the agony that fell upon my young heart! It
seemed that the weight of a mountain rested upon it when I
was told that my husband might be five years absent. He
had already been five years a travelling elder without a home,
trusting for daily bread to the voluntary kindness of the
Saints. He had laboured faithfully, and looked forward to the
day when his “Conference” should be established, and he
could count upon an improvement in his temporal position,
and an early call to emigrate to Zion. In the few months
that I had been his wife, it was only natural that I should
share his hopes; but just at the moment when they were
about to be realized, hopes and expectations were scattered to
the winds.</p>

<p>On the following day the Saints assembled, the Southampton
Conference was organized, and Elder Stenhouse elected
its president. Ten minutes later he was publicly appointed
by the Apostle on a mission to Italy.</p>

<p>During the few days which intervened between the time
when Elder Stenhouse received his appointment, to the hour
of his departure, I enjoyed but little of his society. Arranging
the affairs of the Conference which he was leaving, and
preparation for his mission, fully occupied his attention. I
do not think we either of us uttered a word, when alone
together, respecting the future that was before us. It was
probably better that we did not. There are moments of our
life when silence is better than speech; and it is safer to trust
in the mercy of God than to try to shape our own destiny.</p>

<p>The Saints are noted for the fraternal spirit which exists
among them. There are, of course, exceptions; but, as a rule,
every Mormon is willing to help his brother in the faith, acting
upon the principle “One is your Master, even Christ:
and all ye are brethren.” The Southampton Saints were no
exception to this rule, but showed their kindness both to my
husband and myself in a thousand little ways. I have spoken
of my unhappiness during that week of preparation, but I
must not forget that there were gleams of hope in the darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
One occasion I shall never forget—a picnic which our
friends held as a kind of valedictory feast in honour of the
missionaries—of Elder Stenhouse in particular.</p>

<p>Right up the Southampton river, not far from Netley
Abbey, is a pleasant and picturesque spot, named Bittern,
which I need not too particularly describe, although the
memory of its beauty recalls recollections of mingled sadness
and pleasure to my mind. There my parents now lived, and
thither it was proposed our friends should go. They could
obtain all they needed for the picnic at my father’s house,
and we could take our good things into the woods, and enjoy
ourselves as we pleased. We had a very happy time; for the
moment, even <em>I</em> forgot the cloud that was hanging over me;
and our dear friends not only enjoyed themselves to the
utmost, but seemed bent upon making the time pass pleasantly
to every one else.</p>

<p>I had been talking to Sister White about the recent doings
of the Saints, the establishment of the Conference and the
sending away of Elder Stenhouse. I wanted Sister White, as
in fact I wanted every one else, to think that I was perfectly
happy in the separation, and that I counted my feelings as
a wife as nothing when placed in the balance against my duty
as a missionary; and I tried to impress upon her how proud I
was that my husband should be the first English Elder
entrusted with a foreign mission. We talked together a great
deal. She was still quite a young woman, though married,
and the mother of four darling little children; but probably
she had a better experience than I had, and could see through
my attempts to stifle my natural feelings, while at the same
time she sympathized with me. She spoke very kindly to
me; and as we talked, we wandered inadvertently away from
the rest of the party. Suddenly she thought of her little boy,
and, mother-like, thinking he might be in danger, ran off in
search of him, promising to come back immediately.</p>

<p>I sat down upon the grass to await her return. I was
somewhat excited by the conversation which had passed
between us; but as I sat musing my agitation began to cool
down, and I was soon lost in thought, and did not notice that
I was not alone.</p>

<p>I did not hear the light footsteps near me, and did not see
a little fairy friend, as I called her, pass between me and the sun.
But a tiny hand was laid gently on my shoulder, and looking
up I saw the loving eyes of Mary Burton looking straight down
into mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where have you been, dear?” I asked. “Why, I have
hardly seen you all the day.”</p>

<p>“But I knew you were here,” she said, “and I thought
you were alone; and I wanted to see you, and talk with
you.”</p>

<p>“Come and sit down beside me, Mary,” I said, “and let us
have a little chat together.” Then I drew her gently towards
me, and she sat down by my side. For a few moments we
said nothing, but I was watching her, and waiting to hear
what she would say. She seemed such a pretty, such a
sweet and gentle girl—more like one of those little birds of
glorious plumage and thrilling song that we see glittering
among the dew-drops and the dancing leaves, than a child of
earth. And I pitied her for her beauty, for such beauty is a
snare; and I wondered whether her innocent soul was as fair
and glorious before God as her face was sweet to me; and I
asked whether, in years to come, when the glory of her childish
radiance had passed away, the brightness of a soul pure
and serene would lend a new beauty to her features—the
beauty, not of childish innocence, but of a noble womanhood.</p>

<p>I took her hand in mine, and asked her some trifling question;
but she did not answer. Suddenly she looked up full
into my face, and said, “Sister Stenhouse; I’m very, very sorry
for you.”</p>

<p>“Sorry for <em>me</em>, dear?” I said. “<em>Why</em> should you be sorry?
I am not sad.”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t say so,” she replied; “you know in your
heart you <em>are</em> sad, although you don’t say so. It’s a fine
thing, no doubt, for Elder Stenhouse to go away, though for
my part I’d rather stop at home if I loved any one there; and
at any rate, you must feel sorry that he is going away so far,
if you love him.”</p>

<p>“But Mary,” I said, “you know it is his duty to go; and he
has been called to it by the Apostle, and it is a great honour.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I know that,” she replied, “I know that.” Then
we relapsed into silence for some few moments. Presently
drawing nearer to me, she said again, quite suddenly, “Sister
Stenhouse, do you know the meaning of the word <em>Polygamy</em>?”</p>

<p>“Why, what a funny question to ask me, child!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Child, you call me, Sister Stenhouse; but I’m not a child—at
least not quite a child; I shall be fifteen next birthday.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear,” I said, “I did not mean to offend you; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
I call you ‘child’ because I love you; but you asked me such
a strange question, and used such a strange word.”</p>

<p>This was quite true, for at that time the word Polygamy
was as seldom used as the word “polyandry,” or any other
word signifying a state of things with which we have nothing
to do.</p>

<p>“I’m not offended,” she said; “only people have a way of
treating me as if I were only such a <em>very</em> little girl: I suppose
I look so.”</p>

<p>She certainly did look so, and I suppose she read my
thoughts. Womanhood, by-and-by, brought to her more of
reality, both in face and figure, as well as in the terrible facts
of life; but at that time the term “little fairy,” which I have
so often used respecting her, seemed the most appropriate.
The meaning of that terrible word Polygamy she understood,
in later years, fully as well as I did.</p>

<p>“Well, dear,” I said, “why did you ask me that strange
question?”</p>

<p>“You must promise not to be angry with me if I tell you,”
she answered; “and yet I think you ought to know.”</p>

<p>I readily promised—what could I have refused her?—and
she said,—</p>

<p>“The other day two of the sisters were at our house—I
may not tell you their names for fear of making mischief—and
they were talking together between themselves, and did
not notice that I was present—or else they didn’t care. And
I heard one of them tell the other, that she had heard, secretly,
that in Zion men were allowed to have many wives; and she
used that word Polygamy very often, and said that was
what the people of the world called it.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mary dear,” I replied, “that is no great secret. We
have all heard that said before. Wicked people who hate the
Gospel say that, and a great deal more, in order to bring
scandal upon the Church; but of course it isn’t true.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I haven’t told you all,” she said. “The sisters had
a long talk about it, and they explained whom they heard it
from, and it was from no one outside the Church. And then
one of them said that Elder Stenhouse had heard all about
it, and knew it was true, only of course he did not talk about
such things yet; but that the time would come when everyone
would acknowledge it, and all the Saints would have
many wives. I was frightened when I heard this, and very
angry—for I thought of you—and I spoke to her, and said it
was all untrue, and I’d ask Elder Stenhouse. And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
scolded me very much for saying so, and said it was very
wicked for a child to listen; and that was why I did not like
you to call me ‘child.’”</p>

<p>“Well, darling,” I said, “I’ll not offend you any more in
that way; and it was very good of you to tell me anything
you thought I ought to know.” Then I kissed her, and continued,
“But, after all, I don’t think it’s of any consequence.
It’s the old scandal, just as in the early days they said wicked
things of Christ and His apostles. Elder Stenhouse knows all
that people say, but he has told me again and again that there
is not a word of truth in it; and I believe him.”</p>

<p>“You think so, Sister Stenhouse,” she replied, “and I suppose
I ought to think so too; but if it’s all false how did
people first begin to think of it? People don’t say that the
Mormons are murderers or thieves, because we have given
them no reason to think so. Then why should they think of
such an unheard-of thing as Polygamy—surely there must
have been <em>some</em> reason. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” I answered, “Elder Stenhouse says that some
very wicked men have sometimes joined the Church, and
have done all manner of shocking things, so that they had to
be cut off; and then they went about trying to make other
people believe that the Mormons were as wicked as they
were. There was John C. Bennett, who lived a frightful life
at Nauvoo, and then tried to make out that Joseph Smith
was as bad as he was. And Marsh, the president of the
twelve apostles, and Orson Hyde, when they apostatized not
only said bad things of Joseph, but took affidavit, and swore
solemnly before the magistrates, that the prophet had been
guilty of the most fearful crimes.”</p>

<p>I kissed her again; and she said, “Well, perhaps you are
right;” but I could see that in her heart she was not
convinced.</p>

<p>Then we talked of ourselves and all that interested us, and
she told me all her childish hopes and ambitions; and to me—young
as I was myself—it was pleasant to listen to her innocent
prattle. She promised to come and see me when
Elder Stenhouse had gone, and I should be left alone; and
when we got back to the rest of the party we were as firm
friends as if we had known each other a lifetime.</p>

<p>At midnight, Saturday, June 15th, 1850, the steamer left
Southampton for Havre-de-Grace, bearing on board the first
two Mormon missionaries to Italy; one of them was my
husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The Saints had called in the evening to bid Elder Stenhouse
good-bye; and as he was, of course, to travel “without
purse or scrip,” they vied with each other in showing their
appreciation of his position and his devotion to the faith.
The poorest among them would not be denied the privilege of
contributing their mites to aid in the conversion of the Italians;
and none of the brethren felt that they could show too much
kindness to the departing missionary. Just in this way have
all the foreign missions of the Mormon Church been projected
and sustained; the elements of success were always present—devotion
and self-abnegation on the part of the missionaries,
and an earnest, self-sacrificing disposition on the part of the
people, commanding respect, however erroneous or foolish the
foundation of their faith.</p>

<p>In the bustle of departure, Mr. Stenhouse seemed never to
have thought about himself, and certainly he made no preparation
for me. I had full confidence in him, however, and loved
him devotedly, and knew that my love was returned. But
men who look for miracles, and count upon special providences
for daily bread, are not generally very prudent or far-seeing in
their domestic arrangements. Elder Stenhouse had been told
that “the Lord would provide,” and it therefore seemed to him
superfluous that he should interfere; it would have been a
lack of faith to have shown too much interest in what might
become of me. He left me with only 1<i>l.</i></p>

<p>I now realized the loneliness of my position; there was no
earthly friend to whom I could turn for sympathy at a time
like this. Before my Heavenly Father alone I could pour out
the bitterness of my soul and all my griefs, and in His
presence weep and pray.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">MY HUSBAND’S MISSION—I AM LEFT ALONE.</span></h2>

<p>When the Apostle Snow called upon Mr. Stenhouse to go to
Italy, the Saints willingly accepted the responsibility of providing
for me during his absence.</p>

<p>They thought it was more an honour than a burden to have
this charge committed to them; but it was very humiliating to
me to be placed in such a position, however anxious they
might be to assist me and to serve the general cause. To
face opposition, or to give my all for my religion, I was willing
indeed; but to depend upon others for my daily bread was
utterly repugnant to my feelings, although, of course, if the
Church sent away my husband, whose proper place and duty
it was to support his family, it was only right that the members
of that Church should undertake the responsibility. But
then, and at many other times during my life, I have learned
the truth of Christ’s precept, “It is more blessed to give than
to receive.”</p>

<p>The American Apostle was not without worldly wisdom
when he proposed that an unmarried man should be appointed
to preside over the Southampton Conference, as his wants
would be few. But Mr. Stenhouse had been solicited by a
friend, who had a wife and children, to secure his appointment;
and with ready confidence in that friend, he overlooked
his own interests and my welfare, and I was left to pass
through trials and privations which I can never forget.</p>

<p>The Saints were very kind, and took pleasure in doing all
they could for me; but the mistake which my husband committed
in leaving his friend to succeed him as president of the
Conference was soon apparent. The “friend” thought of his
own family first, and the family required all that the Saints
could reasonably be expected to contribute; and even then they
had not enough. I therefore received only such little sums as
could be withheld from them; and to make the matter worse,
those who had any property or estate were counselled to sell all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and “gather to Zion.” The more wealthy Saints were soon
gone; and the current expenses of the church fell heavily
upon those who were hardly able to support their own
families.</p>

<p>They tried to send me something every week, and I have
no doubt they did send me all that they could. When their
contributions reached four or five shillings (about $1) I
thought myself fortunate; more often I did not receive the
value of fifty cents in the whole week, at times less, and sometimes
nothing at all. That unfailing comfort to respectable
English poverty, a cup of tea, was my greatest luxury, but at
times for weeks together I had not even that; I had nothing
but bread; but I never complained.</p>

<p>Whenever it was possible I concealed my true situation
from every one, and in my almost daily letters to my husband
not a shadow of a hint was ever dropped relative to my own
privations. I wanted him to be successful in his mission,
and I feared that his energy would desert him if he knew of my
difficulties. I was in extreme poverty, certainly, but for myself
I was not in trouble. God would provide for me, I felt; and it
was glorious to suffer in a sacred cause.</p>

<p>But darker days, days of severer trial, were creeping slowly
near me. Up to this time I had worshipped God and loved
my husband with a perfect heart. Now the dark shadow of
an accursed thing was looming in the distance, and approaching
surely if slowly.</p>

<p>In some way an idea had got abroad that the Mormons
were somewhat unsound respecting the marriage question.
Still the elders stoutly denied the charge, and the more they
were accused the more strenuous became their denials.</p>

<p>At a public discussion at Boulogne-sur-mer, in France, the
Apostle John Taylor, in reply to the accusations of Polygamy
which were brought against him, said,—</p>

<p>“We are accused here of actions the most indelicate and disgusting,
such as none but a corrupt and depraved heart could
have conceived. These things are too outrageous to admit of
belief.... I shall content myself with quoting our views
of chastity and marriage from a work published by us, containing
some of our articles of faith—Doctrine and Covenants.”</p>

<p>He then proceeded to quote from the “Book of Doctrine and
Covenants” such passages as the following:—</p>

<p>“Marriage is ordained by God unto man; wherefore it is
lawful that he should have <em>one</em> wife, and they <em>twain</em> should be
<em>one</em> flesh” (p. 218).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>He quoted many other things also, among which might be
enumerated the following:—</p>

<p>“Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt
cleave unto her, and none else.”</p>

<p>He quoted also many other passages of Scripture which had
reference to the subject—each powerful to put aside even
the idea of polygamy; and each equally powerful as an argument
against polygamy itself.</p>

<p>Let the reader here note the value of what Mormons say
when their faith is called in question. See and judge.</p>

<p>Brother Taylor, who spoke at that meeting, and utterly
denied polygamy, had himself—at that very moment when he
so atrociously perjured himself, and when he swore that no
Mormon had more than one wife—<em>five wives</em> living in Salt
Lake City. One of his friends there present had two wives;
and the other was married to a mother, and her own
daughter!</p>

<p>Any conclusion, any expression of disgust at these abominations
and deliberate perjuries, I leave to the reader.</p>

<p>Among those who came to see Mr. Stenhouse before he left
for Italy, was Elder Margetts, an English elder of some prominence
in the British mission. At the picnic of which I have
already spoken, I noticed that this elder was more than usually
attentive to a pretty young sister who was also present. There
was always an affectionate familiarity among the Saints; as I
previously mentioned, they were like brothers and sisters, and
addressed each other as such. But the attentions of the elder
I speak of pointed a little beyond all this. He could not, perhaps,
be accused of any open impropriety, but he certainly
looked much more like the girl’s lover than an ordinary friend
or her spiritual adviser.</p>

<p>I knew this Elder’s family in London, and his conduct
pained me a good deal. So I drew the attention of my
husband to the circumstance; and he said the Elder was
foolish, but he would speak to them both; and this he did.</p>

<p>After the departure of the missionaries, this elder remained
for several days. He then returned to London, but it was not
long before he was again in Southampton, and he still paid
marked attention to the same young sister. This caused unpleasant
remarks among the Saints, who at this time certainly
did not believe that polygamy was practised in Utah.</p>

<p>At a later date this Elder, with some others, was again in
Southampton, and I was invited to take tea with them at the
house of one of the Saints. In the course of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
there was a general conversation on “the work of the Lord,”
in which I, of course, was greatly interested.</p>

<p>Whenever any of the missionaries were visiting, the Saints
would seek their society, just like children who were glad to
meet again their parents after a long absence; and at such
times they were at liberty to ask what questions they pleased.
On the evening I speak of, I well remember that the general
subject of conversation was the apostasy of the Christian
Church from the true order of God’s salvation. Prominence
was given to the history of Abraham and his descendants, and
occasional allusion was made to their marital relations; but
nothing directly was spoken. It was very evident that these
elders only wanted to drop a word or two here and there, to
suit those who wanted it; but nevertheless they spoke so
obscurely and mysteriously that they could easily have retracted
what was said if any one had accused them of teaching
a doctrine which they were unwilling openly to avow.</p>

<p>When I returned home that night I was fully satisfied that
the Elder I have spoken of had a reason for his frequent visits
to Southampton, and shortly after the young sister went to
London. Whether Polygamy was ever to be a doctrine of the
Church or not, it was very clear to me that the London Elder
was a polygamist at heart. The more my mind dwelt on
these things, the more sick at heart did I become, and faint
and weary.</p>

<p>I had, however, personal cares and trials enough to engage
my attention. I found that I could not depend upon the
Saints to provide me with even the barest necessaries of life,
so I looked about me and made inquiries for some light employment
by which I might support myself. My health at
that time would not have allowed me to do much, but for a
long time I could not get anything at all to do. I had, of
course, been used to teaching, but employment of that kind it
was just then impossible for me to take, even if I could have
got it; the only resource which seemed left to me was to
find occupation for my needle, and it was a long and weary
time before I could obtain even this.</p>

<p>At length I got a little plain sewing to do, and out of the
miserable pittance thus earned I contrived to pay my rent and
provide a few necessaries; but at times that too was beyond
my power, and I have gone a fortnight at a time with nothing
to eat but dry bread. Still my faith never failed. And thus
the weary days passed by.</p>

<p>Now, however, a new interest began to gather round my life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for I expected before the end of the year the arrival of a little
stranger to share my affections and my care. This certainly
was a sad beginning of domestic bliss, but still the thought
was pleasant to me. I had at that time no one to aid me or
comfort me. The Saints were very kind, but they could not
supply the place of an absent husband. My dearest friend,
Mary Burton, used to come as often as she could to see me,
and her presence was like a gleam of sunshine; but she was
so young, and innocent, and happy, that I had not the heart
to trouble her with my sorrows. All my jewellery and trinkets,
and the greater part of my wardrobe, had gone in providing for
my daily wants, and in preparing those necessary trifles upon
which a young mother bestows so much loving care. My
health was daily failing, and sometimes I doubted if I should
ever be well and strong again. But all that I suffered was for
the Church, and that thought sustained me.</p>

<p>Often I would sit alone and think—think of the past, and
all my early day-dreams of love, and hope, and bliss; think
of my husband in a far-off land devoting his life and all his
energies to the preaching of the latter-day glory; think of those
whisperings of that accursed doctrine which has since brought
desolation and anguish to the hearts of so many weary women;
think of my future life, dark as its promise even then appeared.</p>

<p>Sometimes I heard from Italy—heard how my husband was
progressing with his work, and with wifely love I sympathized
with him in all his difficulties, for he told me how arduous the
task was in which he was engaged.</p>

<p>It was not the expectation of the Mormon Apostles that the
missionaries would do much in Catholic Italy. The same
causes were in operation there as affected the work in France.
Few, if any, really good Roman Catholics have ever joined the
Saints. The Irish mission was never successful, and the same
may be said of the French and Italian missions. In France
and Italy by far the greater part of the people might be classed
under two heads—Roman Catholics, and infidels. The first
had already an infallible guide in which they trusted; and as
for the infidels, they ridiculed the idea of any guide at all.
Both classes were utterly devoid of that acquaintance with
Scripture of which the Mormon missionaries understood so
well how to take advantage, and which rendered those so susceptible
to religious influences who took the Bible as their
basis. The missionaries in Italy soon experienced the difficulties
presented by these facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>After their arrival in Genoa, Mr. Stenhouse was directed to
carry the gospel to the Waldenses—those brave old Protestants
of the dark ages, who so manfully suffered, even unto death,
for conscience sake; and some time after he had begun his
labours among them, the Apostle Snow joined him.</p>

<p>Whatever they might believe or teach theoretically, there
can be no doubt that the American Apostles were largely endowed
with the “organ” of caution. Preaching without purse
or scrip among people who either detest you as a heretic or
else regard you with profound indifference is not a pleasant
task, and the Mormon Apostles very prudently “took up”
liberal collections in England before they started. Had it not
been for this common-sense proceeding, I am at a loss to say
what would have become of the missionaries in Italy; and as
it was, their lot was not a very enviable one.</p>

<p>Besides the scarcity of money, the other great difficulty experienced
by the missionaries was learning the language of
their destined converts. For many years it was supposed
among the Saints that the “gift of tongues” would be all-sufficient
for this purpose. The two distinguished Apostles,
Orson and Parley P. Pratt, whose writings did so much for
Mormonism, had both of them eloquently discussed the subject
in print; but the missionaries soon discovered that for practical
purposes the “gift” was not of much service; and the two
Pratts themselves afterwards experienced—the one in South
America and the other in Austria—the fallacy of their theories.
Without the “gift” in any shape the work in Italy was necessarily
very slow, and an Elder who could speak a little French
was sent out from London to assist them. They had at last
come to the conclusion that if the Lord would not bestow the
“gift” upon them, they must try to acquire it themselves.</p>

<p>The Apostle Snow now thought of sending the Gospel to
the Swiss, and Mr. Stenhouse was selected for the work. But
before he went it was determined that the Church in Italy
should be “organized,” and about a week later, I received a
long account of how this was done. I heard how, one pleasant
November morning, the Apostle Snow, Elders Stenhouse
and Woodward, together with several Waldenses whom they
had converted, ascended the mountain side contiguous to La
Tour, and overlooking the fertile valley of Pinerello. There
they sang praises and prayed. They christened the place
“Mount Brigham;” and the stone upon which the three elders
stood and offered up a written prayer, they named “The Rock
of Prophecy;” and there they organized the church, dedicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the soil of Italy to the Lord. Moreover, then and there
my husband was solemnly consecrated a “High-Priest after
the Order of the Son of God.”</p>

<p>All this I heard, and much more; and in confiding faith that
this was indeed a great and glorious work, I rejoiced that I
had been accounted worthy to suffer patiently at home, if only
my husband might successfully fulfil his task abroad.</p>

<p>After that I heard that he had left Italy, and had arrived in
Geneva, believing that he would be more successful among the
Swiss than the Italians.</p>

<p>A few days after the arrival of the missionary in Geneva,
an event occurred which interested my own self personally—my
little Clara was born. Very happy was I when I looked
upon her tiny little face for the first time, and kissed her for
being the prettiest baby in the world; very happy was I
when I folded her in my arms, and talked to her as if she
could understand all that I said; very happy indeed, as I
looked at her again and again, and marvelled whether she
really could be, indeed and certainly, my own baby girl. It
seemed as if baby’s papa would never come back again, but I
had a companion now in my child; and weak and weary as I
was, with new responsibilities and less power to help myself,
I found comfort in my new care, and realized the truth of the
old Scotch song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Muckle lichter is the load</div>
<div class="verse">When luve bears up the creel.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I was not now alone.</p>

<p>Then, too, came round to see me, Mary Burton. She was
as fond and tender to me as ever, and tripped quietly about
the room, and tried to wait upon me, and sat by the bed, playing
with baby, calling her all the pretty things she could
think of; and I felt that her presence brought new light and
life to my room. She brought me another letter from my
husband, and I found that he was now acquiring for himself
the “gift” of the French tongue, unable to do much else, as
he and everybody didn’t understand each other. He could not
yet talk to the French-speaking Genevese; and the English-speaking
residents would not listen to him; they had only
heard of Mormonism as a clumsy fraud, and looked upon the
prophet Joseph Smith as an impostor. So, for a whole winter,
he sat shut up in his own room, poring over a French grammar,
and deploring his hard fate in being denied the gift of
tongues.</p>

<p>In the spring of the new year I received a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
visitor, who kindly interested himself in my welfare. The
Apostle Lorenzo Snow left Piedmont for England, and passed
through Geneva <i lang="fr">en route</i>. On his way to London he called
upon me at Southampton, and expressed much sympathy for
me. He noticed the change in my appearance, and immediately
sent for Mr. Stenhouse to return to England. He acted very
kindly by me at that time; did all that he could to assist me,
and said that he never again would ask any man to make such
a sacrifice. I fully appreciated all his kindness; but much as
I wanted to, I did not venture to ask him about the truth or
falsity of those terrible suggestions which I had heard whispered
of late.</p>

<p>My husband hastened home, coming by way of Calais, in
order to meet his president and receive his instructions. The
Apostle showed much sympathy for him, and very early in the
morning accompanied him some miles to the railway station;
but he never once mentioned how I had been situated in
Southampton until he left him, and then he exacted from him
a promise not to open his lips whatever he might learn.</p>

<p>I need not say that I was happy to see my husband once
again, and to present to him his little daughter, who was now
five months old. He was, of course, soon busy in visiting the
Saints, and he received from them many tokens of attachment.</p>

<p>In the beginning of June a General Conference of the
branches of the Church in Britain was held in London. The
Apostles and foreign missionaries were present, and my husband
and I were also there. We had speeches and prayers.
The business of the Conference occupied but very few minutes,
for no measure was questioned. Among the Mormons there
are no opinions, no discussion. The presiding head has made
out his programme before he comes to the Conference; he
knows what he wants to do, and no one ever questions him.
He may perhaps for form’s sake invite the brethren to speak
on any point he introduces; but when he has furnished the
clue to his wishes, the Elders who speak only spend their time
in arguments in favour of his measures. At the Conference of
which I speak the reports of the native elders were very cheering
to us. Throughout England and Wales they had been
most successful in adding members to the Church. Mormonism
was then most successfully preached in Britain. There
were more Mormons there than in all Utah Territory: there
were fifty Conferences, with over seven hundred organized
“branches,” and more than six thousand men ordained to
the priesthood. That peculiar influence which the Mormons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
call “the Spirit,” of which I have spoken elsewhere, was
spoken of by the Elders as being a common experience everywhere.</p>

<p>During all that Conference I listened carefully for a word
from the lips of any of the speakers which might indicate in
any way that Polygamy was part of the Mormon faith; but
not a whisper, not a hint, was uttered. I naturally concluded
that the Elders, whose doubtful expressions at Southampton
had so troubled my mind, were misinformed or unsafe men.
Still I could not altogether banish my apprehension of coming
evil; but so bound to secrecy were those who did know of
Polygamy being practised in Utah, that there was not one
who would admit it, and even my own husband’s lips were
sealed to me. He did not deny it, but he would not talk
about it, and did everything he could to banish the thought
from my mind.</p>

<p>At that Conference the Apostle Snow spoke very strongly
of the way in which I had been neglected; and it was arranged
that Elder Stenhouse should return to Switzerland,
and that I should accompany him. My knowledge of French
was expected to be very serviceable.</p>

<p>We now made preparations for an early departure, and prepared
to leave our friends. To the reader it may seem strange
for a man, his wife, and babe, to be sent out in this way on a
mission without any proper arrangement for their maintenance;
but to my mind, at the time, it seemed to me not only
perfectly proper, but altogether in accordance with God’s word
and commandment.</p>

<p>My young friend, Mary Burton, came round to bid me good-bye;
and the poor girl wept, and I wept with her, and we
kissed one another tenderly as our tears mingled. We had
become very dear to each other, and the thought of separation
for years, or perhaps for ever, was very painful to us. She
hung about my neck at the last moment, kissing me, and begging
me not to forget to write to her very, very often; and
this I gladly promised her, asking the same in return. Then
with a fond embrace we parted, and it was years before I saw
her dear face again.</p>

<p>Thus it was that we three—my husband, my babe, and
myself—set forth on our pilgrimage to convert the Swiss.</p>

<p>It was with no ordinary feelings that I entered the ancient
city of Geneva. I was not ignorant of its history, and the
struggles of its inhabitants for civil and religious liberty. It
had been the refuge for the English Protestants during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
fiery days of Queen Mary; just as in the time of the French
Revolution it was the refuge of infidel and Papist, royalist
and republican alike. There Calvin lived in gloomy austerity,
battling with Rome; there Servetus, the Unitarian, was condemned
to be roasted alive as a heretic; and there we expected
in our own humble way to be able to testify, by our
suffering and patience, to what we firmly believed was the
truth.</p>

<p>In free countries like England and the United states—free
from the surveillance of a military police, it is easy, if he
wishes it, for the missionary to mount a chair at a street corner,
or hold forth under a tree; and such has often been done.
But all over continental Europe there is hardly a place where
this would be possible. In the various grand duchies, kingdoms,
and empires, paternal governments look too closely after
the morals and religion of their subjects; while under the
ephemeral republics, as long as they happen to last, there is
often to be found, under the name of liberty, a despotism more
despotic than under the rule of royalty. It is the <i lang="fr">colporteur</i>,
the man of books and tracts, who makes the converts there;
and in this slow way we soon found that we were destined to
proceed.</p>

<p>During my husband’s former stay in Geneva he had had
neither Mormon books nor Mormon papers, with the exception
of a paper published at Boulogne, containing a letter by the
Apostle Taylor, in French and English. This single copy he
lent to a Genevese to read, and never saw it again; and yet
in a short time, even before he could properly speak French,
he converted and baptized two men in the Rhone, one of
whom is to-day a devoted Mormon in Southern Utah.</p>

<p>His first attack was upon a shoemaker, whom he visited for
the purpose of repairs. While the shoemaker worked, Elder
Stenhouse talked; and as the English are all reputed wealthy
on the continent, the friendly overtures of the Mormon missionary
were graciously received. As they grew intimate,
Elder Stenhouse would sit down on the bench beside the man
as he worked, and taking from his pocket a French Testament,
which he always carried about with him, would try to read it
aloud—the good-natured shoemaker undertaking to correct
his pronunciation. In this way he kept his auditor’s attention
constantly fixed upon certain passages, more especially those
which spoke of baptism for the remission of sins, and the
laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. So persistent
was he that at last the shoemaker’s curiosity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
awakened, and finally he was baptized; but unfortunately, not
long after a small pamphlet upon the mission of Joseph Smith
fell into his hands, and made shipwreck of his faith.</p>

<p>With his second convert he was much more successful.
This time it was his landlord who was to be the subject of
attack. He was a tailor, and, fortunately for the missionary,
somewhat talkative. The same arrangement was made about
reading and correction, and with a like result—the tailor was
baptized. Just at this time came the Apostle Snow’s letter,
telling my husband to return to England; and as he might
not leave the country without a representative, he ordained
the tailor a priest in the Mormon Church.</p>

<p>When we arrived in Geneva, <i lang="fr">Monsieur le tailleur</i> was all
that constituted the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Soon a few personal friends began to gather, to hear the
English missionary tell about the new religion; and my husband
being very much in earnest, interest before long began
to be excited. I remember well our first meetings among the
Swiss—half-a-dozen people sitting round a table with open
Bibles before them, passages from which Mr. Stenhouse was
trying in very bad French to make them understand. I pitied
him very much, but those who were present made as if they
did not notice his embarrassment, and listened with marked
attention. Among the Mormons it is a woman’s duty to keep
silence; I therefore remained a listener only. But at the
close of the service—for such it was regarded—when I might
speak, my missionary labours began; I was aroused to eloquence,
and our parting was longer than our meeting.</p>

<p>The warmth with which the few who were present responded
to our efforts satisfied me that they had come under the same
mysterious influence which I had observed in England. I
was then convinced that Mormonism could awaken the Christian
soul more to a realization of what it already possessed,
than impart to it any new moral or religious qualities. Mormonism
of itself never made Christians, but Christianity
built up Mormonism. It was an awakening to the teachings
of Christ and His Apostles that begat confidence in the mission
of the Mormon Prophet.</p>

<p>Although we observed the very strictest economy, it did
not take long for us to exhaust what little money we brought
from England. This placed us in a very awkward position.
It is inconvenient enough to be without money in one’s own
country, where one understands and is understood by everybody;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
but to be in a strange land, especially in a country like
Switzerland, where every Englishman is supposed to be a
“milor” and the bounteous dispenser of unlimited wealth, it is
more than inconvenient.</p>

<p>We left our first quarters, where we had had so many visitors,
and rented a room from a widow woman, who fortunately was
not inquisitive. She had a family of children to support; and
as we paid our rent monthly in advance, she had no occasion
to know whether or not we kept a bank account; and we were
thankful that it was so, for, had it been so ordained, we could
there have starved to death without attracting the notice of
any one. A nice thing to be thankful for!</p>

<p>We were not hopeless, though we were heavy hearted; but
we had expected trial, and could not complain, for we knew
from the beginning that thus it would probably be.</p>

<p>One day my husband received a letter from an infidel gentleman
who lived in Lausanne, a neighbouring canton, requesting
him to come and see him, that they might talk
together over Mormonism, for he had heard of us and of our
doctrine; and my husband resolved to visit him before our
money was all gone.</p>

<p>When Mr. Stenhouse reached Lausanne, he visited first a
Protestant minister with whom he had some slight acquaintance,
and who was also interested in Mormonism, and told
him that he was going to call upon the Gouverneur de
l’Hôpital. The minister was greatly opposed to my husband
visiting such a man. “He is a socialist,” he said, “a revolutionist;
he fought at the barricades; he is a <i lang="fr">mauvais sujet</i>,
and anything but a fit person to be spoken to about religion.”</p>

<p>This only increased the interest which Mr. Stenhouse felt
in the governor, and made him more than ever determined to
see him; and he did see him, although the good minister had
represented him “<i lang="fr">aussi noir que le diable</i>.” So they met; and
my husband began the work for which he had come. They
had long talks together, and my husband—as did the elders
ever in such cases—spoke to the governor of redemption
through Christ, and baptism for the remission of sins. Faith
is not an act of the will. Like the unseen wind, it comes, and
we see the power thereof, but know not whence it proceeds.
Thus at first the unbelieving governor found it; he might
find himself no match for the arguments of his opponent, but
he could not force his heart to believe, and he was by no
means a willing convert. My husband, however, remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with him; and before he left, the governor had been baptized
into the church.</p>

<p>Our new convert proved to be a most excellent and worthy
man, notwithstanding his former infidelity, and he was subsequently
a great aid to us in our mission. We felt satisfied
that the expenses of that journey had been well spent, although
a few francs at that time could ill be spared.</p>

<p>But our circumstances seemed to be getting worse and
worse, and my health began to fail. For several months
neither of us had had sufficient nourishment, and my anxieties
increased my physical weakness. I was dispirited, yet I feared
to complain, or even to let my husband know what I felt. At
length I fell really ill, and could not leave my bed. I well
remember the solemn silence that reigned in our home one
day. I had risen from my bed, weak, and oh, so faint-hearted
that I had scarcely any desire to live; and I was
sitting with my little daughter in my arms. She had cried
herself to sleep, cold and hungry, and, much as I loved her—nay,
idolized her—I confess that for an instant I harboured in
my soul the impious, the unnatural wish, that rather than see
my darling awake again to cold and hunger, she might sleep
her sweet young life away. For <em>me</em> to yield to such a thought—to
wish my child to wake no more! I, who would have
given gladly the last drop of my life-blood to save her! For
<em>me</em> to look upon her innocent little face with such a thought!
I can hardly now believe that such a thing was possible,
even for a moment. But I was desperate, and bold, and
cowardly—all at the same time; or my heart was humiliated
by poverty, and my faith was rousing bitter thoughts in my
mind.</p>

<p>My husband was pacing the room. I knew too well all that
was passing in his mind, although we had long been silent.
At length I said to him, “Take courage, dear, for we are the
servants of the great God, and surely He will find a means of
escape for us. We were sent here; we came because the
Lord wanted us to come, and surely He will provide for us!”</p>

<p>He turned to me in reply, and said kindly, “We can at
least have some water;” and he went for some water; and then,
with as reverential feeling in his soul as ever inspired a grace
before dinner, he blessed it, and we drank.</p>

<p>We had scarcely done so when the mail-courier brought a
letter to our door.</p>

<p>Governor Stoudeman, with a feeling of delicacy, had hesitated,
when my husband visited him at Lausanne, to offer him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
any assistance; but, he said in his letter, he had been “impressed”
to do so, and hoped that we should not be offended.
As the letter was opened, a piece of gold fell upon the table.
We could hardly believe that God had so soon answered our
prayers, and sent us relief; and our emotions of gratitude for
this timely aid, found expression in tears.</p>

<p>All this time our landlady knew nothing of our distress;
she was as ignorant of our situation as if she had never seen
us. So long as I was able to walk about, I used at regular
hours to go to the kitchen, get the cooking utensils, and go
through the routine of cooking, as if we had had a well-filled
larder all the time. I set the table with punctilious care, and
the good old widow never suspected but that we had plenty.
Thus supposing that we wanted nothing, she and her children
were more than ordinarily kind to us and to our little girl,
who was now old enough to toddle round and go from room to
room. Very often they would get her into their room at
meal-time, and give her little things to please her; and while
they felt honoured in being permitted to do so, we were
silently thankful for our child’s sake, for her sufferings were
more than we could endure.</p>

<p>The temporary aid from Lausanne was very welcome to us,
though it only served to make us feel more keenly our
dependent position. I might relate stories, alas, too true! of
cold and want; of days, and even almost an entire week, passed
at one time without food—stories which for painful detail
would eclipse romance. It was a weary waiting for Providence!
Such things are better forgotten. And yet I feel
that in after years my temper was more subdued, and my
mind more patient under affliction, than it would have been
had I not experienced this preparatory discipline.</p>

<p>People who have heard, with a sneer, of Mormon missionaries
and their work, would perhaps have realized that faith
may be sincere, although mistaken, if they could have seen us
at that time. The first teachers of a doctrine, whether it be
good or evil, if only it stems the current opinions of the hour,
have ever found that at the end of a rocky way there was
waiting for them a crown of thorns.</p>

<p>Many a time since then I have felt the weight of anxious
care in providing for my family; the trial of our faith has not
been light, or seldom repeated; but those days of trouble in
Switzerland were, I think, the darkest I ever experienced.
We realized literally the necessity of trusting to God’s daily
mercies for our daily bread; and the assurance that the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
would provide, was our only hope. To say that we practised
the strictest economy, would be to give but a faint idea of the
way in which we had to consider and contrive in order to
exist at all. For years we kept the “Word of Wisdom”—a
“Revelation of Joseph Smith,” which enjoined abstinence
from wine, coffee, tea, or, in fact, warm drinks of any kind;
and trifling as such self-denial may at first appear, it was not
really so when other privations were added thereto. For
months at a time we existed—for I dare not say lived—without
what are considered, even by the poorest, the most
common necessaries. I can even recall to mind one trying
week in Switzerland, when, for the whole seven long days, we
had less than a pint of corn-flour to live upon, and that was
chiefly reserved for our poor child.</p>

<p>As I look back to those dark, painful times I feel that it
was by little short of a miracle that our lives were spared.
Our faith alone saved us.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">OUR MISSION IN SWITZERLAND—MUTTERINGS OF THE
COMING STORM.</span></h2>

<p>Very soon after this we were notified that the Apostle Snow
was on his way to Switzerland, and that we might shortly
expect him.</p>

<p>This to me was joyful news, for he had relieved me of my
trouble once before, and I almost looked upon him as my
good angel. He came, and remained with us a few days; and
before he left he instructed Mr. Stenhouse to repair to England,
to raise funds to aid the mission. He also gave me a
few pounds to procure what I needed for an event which I
expected shortly to take place. This kindness on his part
brought to my mind such a sense of relief, and so renewed
my energy, that I felt ready for my missionary labours
again.</p>

<p>When my second child was about two months old I went
to Lausanne to reside, while my husband was absent in
England. Apartments were engaged for me at the house of
a gentleman who had recently been baptized. I was made
very comfortable there, and for the first time since my husband
was sent on a mission, I experienced a feeling of repose,
so that I now had some hopes of regaining mental and physical
strength. No provision had been made by the Saints for my
support; but even without that, I thought, living among those
who were themselves happy, and one with us in the faith, I
should myself find more tranquillity of mind.</p>

<p>Madame and Monsieur Balif, in whose house I resided, were
persons of good social position. The husband was one of
nature’s gentlemen, and as good a man as I ever knew. He
received the Mormonism taught by Mr. Stenhouse with all
his heart, and never seemed weary of showing his gratitude
by his good deeds. Madame Balif did not at once join the
church, and probably never would have done so but for the
love which she bore to her husband. She was not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
hostile to the new faith, as some other wives were, and she
did all that she could to render pleasant my stay with them,
and tried to make me forget what I had suffered in Geneva.</p>

<p>Madame Balif was a high-spirited, impulsive woman, and
devotedly attached to her husband; I never saw a woman
more so. She impressed me as being one of the happiest of
wives; he one of the best of husbands. After I had lived in
the house a few weeks, she was baptized; but she never was
satisfied with Mormonism. Poor, dear lady! How often
have I bitterly regretted that I was instrumental in leading
her into the Mormon Church, in which, as (years later, in
Utah) she told me, she endured such cruel humiliation and
martyrdom. I knew well indeed then what all that meant.</p>

<p>While I lived with them, it was agreed that I should pay
for my apartments monthly; but after I had paid for the first
month, Monsieur Balif told me that I should do so no more.
And knowing that he meant it as an expression of kindness
and gratitude on his part, I felt relieved of all anxiety on that
account. All that I had, even then, for the support of myself
and my two little ones was about five francs ($1) a week; but
my wants were few, for I had taught myself to require nothing
but what was absolutely necessary to keep me alive.</p>

<p>During Mr. Stenhouse’s absence, the meetings were held in
my parlour; and as the brethren who had joined the church
had not previously been religious men, though they were persons
of the best moral character, they were very diffident
about conducting the meetings, and for a time could not think
of praying before others. It devolved upon me—of sheer
necessity, for I disliked prominence as much as they did—to
lead the singing, to pray, to preach—in fact, to do everything.
Had I not done so, they would have sat looking at
each other, for they were all too timid to speak. I encouraged
them in every way to try, and finally we got along very well.
A “good spirit” prevailed; and we were like a little band of
brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The only person, now, who gave me any anxiety was
Madame Balif, who was very weak in the faith. Her doubts
and fears troubled me much, for I had conceived a very great
regard for her. I feared that with a heart so proud and rebellious
as hers, she would never get salvation, and I trembled
for her happiness. How slight a hold the new faith had taken
of her mind, I was forcibly reminded by an incident which
was at the time a great trial to me.</p>

<p>My little daughter fell sick of intermittent fever, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dared not call in a physician; it would not do for me, a missionary’s
wife, to show lack of faith. Such was our zeal in
those days. But now, as I once before stated, even the most
orthodox Mormons, including Brigham Young, do not think
of relying upon God and the ordinances of the church, as
they used to in former years, but call in the best physician
they can get.</p>

<p>I was much troubled about my little girl, for she was evidently
failing fast. She had been “administered to” by one
of the native elders, who had anointed her with oil, and prayed
over her; but yet she did not get better. Madame Balif, in
the midst of my affliction, taunted me about the child not recovering,
and asked where was the power of God, of which I
had talked so much: “Now,” she said “if you could get that
child healed, it would be some proof to my mind that the
power you speak of is still in the church.” I felt ashamed
that I had not exercised more faith. I was certain that the
gift of healing <em>was</em> in the church, and I believed it was my
own fault that the child was not even now well. In my zeal
I replied rather warmly, “My child <em>will</em> be healed, and you
shall see it.” But I had no sooner uttered these words than
I began to fear I had promised too much.</p>

<p>I determined, however, that nothing on my part should be
left undone. I sent for Governor Stoudeman, our new convert,
as he was the president of the branch and an elder. I
told him that this child <em>must</em> be healed by the power of God.
We had not witnessed any manifestation of the healing power
among the Saints in Switzerland up to that time; and I
earnestly desired that now for the first time this gift might be
proved among us, for the sake of the church as well as for my
own. So I told the governor that it was his duty, as well as
mine, to fast and pray that the Lord might grant us this blessing,
that it might be a testimony that it was His work and that
we were His servants.</p>

<p>He became as enthusiastic as I was myself, and we fasted
and prayed for nearly two days. At the end of that time he
came to see me, and by the bedside we knelt and prayed; and
he laid his hands upon the child, and blessed her in the name
of the Lord.</p>

<p>That night the child was very low; and though I strove to
show my faith, I dreaded that she would have her usual attack
of fever about midnight. After the departure of the
elder, Madame Balif came into the room, and said, “Your
child is very ill; if your God cannot help her, why do not you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
send for a physician?” This appeared to me so profane, and
such an insult to my God and my faith, that I replied indignantly,
“Madame, she <em>will</em> and <em>shall</em> be healed this very
night; for I know that power is in the church. The reason
why the child was not healed before is, because I have not
been earnest enough in seeking the Lord.”</p>

<p>When I was left alone I sat down by the bedside, trembling
lest I had been too rash in declaring that the child would be
healed that same night. Much and fondly as I loved my little
treasure, I confess that I suffered more at the thought of
God’s name suffering reproach than I did from fear of my
darling’s death; and I tried earnestly to banish my doubts,
with the remembrance that all things are possible to them that
believe.</p>

<p>Kneeling there in the dark and lonesome midnight, I
poured out my soul fervently to God, beseeching Him, for
His kingdom’s sake, and for the glory of His great name, to
answer, and not to suffer my unworthiness to stand in the
way. I watched hour after hour beside my darling’s bed,
and the child slept on peacefully, without any symptoms of
returning fever; and, oh! how anxiously I waited for her
awaking.</p>

<p>At last, worn out with fatigue and watching, I laid myself
down on the bed beside her, and soon fell asleep; and when I
awoke it was daylight, and my little one was peacefully sleeping
on still—the fever had left her. No tongue could tell the
gratitude which filled my heart; I could only weep tears of
joy, and sing aloud my praise to God.</p>

<p>Madame Balif entered the room early in the morning to see
what kind of a night we had passed. Then I drew her to the
bedside, and told her how tranquilly the child had slept all
night, and showed her how much better she looked, and asked
her if she did not see in all this the providence of God. But
she simply said, “Ah, well! I suppose the disease had run
its course.” This grieved me, for I had trusted that such a
direct answer to my prayers would have helped to increase
her faith in our religion; but Mormonism had not touched her
heart; and I believe it is much more the devotion of the heart
than it is the mental acquiescence in doctrine which gives us
the power to hope, and endure, and believe.</p>

<p>When, by-and-by, my little Clara awoke, she was evidently
very much better, and not only free from the fever, but
bright and cheerful, like her former self; and she never relapsed.
In the course of a week she was running about as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
well as ever, and the Saints were greatly confirmed in their
faith.</p>

<p>One morning, not long after this, Madame Balif brought me
a letter which, as it bore the English postmark, she supposed
came from my husband. The writing, however, was strange
to me; and dreading that some terrible thing might have
happened, I tore it open. There, at the bottom of the last
page—for the letter was very long—in neat, clear characters,
was the signature of my fairy friend, as I called her, Mary
Burton. I read the letter through with the deepest interest.
It was addressed “To darling Sister Stenhouse,” and was
overflowing with affection. Used as I was to all her endearing
ways, I could almost fancy that while I read I heard her
speaking the words. After a great outpouring of love, she
said,—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since you went, I have grown quite an old woman. You
used to call me ‘Little fairy,’ but, Sister Stenhouse, I am
much bigger now. I am now a good deal over seventeen,
and people say that I am getting to be quite a woman. I
might tell you some other pretty things that are said about
me, but I’m afraid you would say it was all vanity of vanities.
If you stay away much longer, you won’t recognize me when
we meet again.</p>

<p>“And now I want to tell you something that interests you as
much as me. I have not been able to discover anything more
with certainty about those hateful things of which I told you,
although the word Polygamy seems to me to become every
day much more familiar in people’s conversation. Elder
Shrewsbury tells me that there is not a word of truth in it;
and he has had a good deal of conversation upon that subject
with the apostles who are here, and also with a man named
Curtis E. Bolton—an Elder from the Salt Lake; and they all
positively declare that it is a foul slander upon the Saints
of the Most High. So you see that all our unhappiness was
for naught. Our Saviour said we should be blessed when all
men spoke evil of us falsely for His name’s take; and the
wicked scandal which has been raised against our religion has
had a tendency to strengthen my faith, which you know was
rather wavering.</p>

<p>“And yet do you know, Sister Stenhouse, that even while I
am writing to you in this strain, I am weak enough to allow
doubts and fears to creep into my heart when I think of the
conduct of some of the American brethren.</p>

<p>“They appear to me, for married men, to act <em>so very</em> imprudently;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and to call their conduct ‘imprudent’ is really
treating it with the greatest leniency, for I have often been
quite shocked at the way in which some of the brethren and
sisters acted. But I will tell you a little about it, and you
shall judge for yourself.</p>

<p>“When I found out, as I had long suspected, that dear papa
was going to marry again, I at once resolved that I would no
longer be a burden to him, but would find some employment,
and support myself. I was induced to do this, partly because as
you know, step-mothers and daughters do not always love each
other quite as much as they might. So I communicated my
wishes to papa, and told him that I had been introduced to a
very nice lady, who had a large dressmaking establishment
at the west end of London. She is a member of the Church,
and has always been very highly spoken of. I told him that
she employed a number of highly respectable young girls, and
that four, at least, of them were members of the Church, and
that, in consideration of my lonely situation, and at the earnest
request of Elder Shrewsbury, she was willing to take me into
her house, to board and lodge me, and teach me the business
thoroughly, if my father would pay her a premium of fifty pounds.</p>

<p>“This papa readily agreed to do, as I expected he would,
for he is so taken up with my step-mamma that is to be;
and beside which he has, I know, been unfortunate lately in
some railway speculations, and has lost a great deal of money,
and therefore wishes to economize. In this way I went to
London, and became a member of Mrs. Elsworth’s family—and
here I am still.</p>

<p>“Now you have been in London, Sister Stenhouse, and must
remember ‘the office’ in Jewin Street—the head-quarters
where all the elders congregate, and where the American elders
board, and church business is managed. Well, the very first
week I was at Mrs. Elsworth’s I noticed that the four young
sisters who were working there were constantly talking of
Jewin Street, and the dear American brethren who were stopping
there. One of them in particular was always talking
about dear Elder Snow; and another girl whispered to me
that she went to Jewin Street every evening, and frequently
remained there to tea with him, and went afterwards to the
theatre with him, or to a meeting, as the case might be; and
the young lady added, ‘She does make such a fuss over him,
toying with him, and brushing and combing his hair. I know
that she does it, for I have been there with her, and have seen
her do it; and he appears to enjoy it quite as much as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
does; and I believe, if Polygamy was true he would marry
her.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ I said, ‘it is not true, and therefore it is very
wrong for her to act in that way, for he is a married
man.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, but you know,’ she answered, ‘that we are all brothers
and sisters, and the brethren tell us that those little attentions
make them feel that they are not so far from home, and they
are thus enabled to perform their mission better; and if that
is so, it is the duty of the young sisters to encourage them.
These <em>little attentions</em> cost nothing, and I’m sure it’s quite a
pleasure to me.’</p>

<p>“‘Then <em>you</em> go to Jewin Street?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ she said, ‘sometimes, but not very often, for <em>my</em>
elder calls here frequently, as he is acquainted with Mrs.
Elsworth; and then I take my work up into the parlour sometimes,
and have a long talk with him. Mrs. Elsworth does
not like it, I know, but she does not care to oppose the elders;—in
fact, her husband will not allow any such thing—he has
dared her to do so. After all, she is very silly, for we ought
to love each other and be free and friendly. My elder—I call
him <em>my</em> elder, you know, simply because I like him better than
the others—calls Mrs. Elsworth ‘Gentilish,’ and says she’ll
get over it when she goes to Zion. But she says she won’t.
She is awfully jealous of her husband and a certain Miss Caroline
somebody, though she doesn’t care for him.’</p>

<p>“‘But what difference can it make to him?’ I asked her.
‘He has a wife, and ought not to pay attention to any other
woman.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah, you silly child,’ she said, ‘it is only brotherly love,
after all, and men often have wives who do not make them
happy, and that makes them seek the society of the young
sisters, for those who are far from home are lonely. My own
elder’s wife is here in London, but he isn’t much with her. He
spends nearly all his time in Jewin Street; he is a travelling
Elder, and when he is going anywhere to preach he always
calls for me, as he does not like going alone, he is such a genial
soul. If Polygamy were true, I’d promise to marry him when
we reached the Valley.’</p>

<p>“Then I asked why his wife didn’t go with him; and she
said, ‘Oh, poor man! he has no pleasure in <em>her</em> society. She
is always moping and unhappy. You know, some women are
naturally so. I do all I can to make him feel well, for it must
be awful to be married to a woman who is always sad.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“I asked her <em>why</em> his wife should be so unhappy; and she
said, ‘He tells me that she has got it into her head that
somehow or other Polygamy is practised in Zion; and I’m
sure I, for one, wish it was so, for then we could marry whoever
we pleased.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, for shame!’ I said. ‘I’m sure I’d never go there, if I
thought so.’</p>

<p>“Then I asked her whether she did not think it was wrong
for her to encourage the attentions of <em>her</em> elder; and she said,
‘He wishes it just as much as I do; and his wife had better
behave herself, or I’ll marry him whether Polygamy exists or
not in Zion; and he does not know, though we both suspect,
that there <em>is</em> something in the rumours which we have heard.’
Then I told her I thought it was very wicked to encourage
the visits of that man; for I believe that if he paid a little more
attention to his wife she would be less unhappy—for I suppose
she knew of his attentions to her.</p>

<p>“She said the wife knew nothing about it; that he was
obliged to be out late at night, preaching, or at Jewin Street—which
I knew meant flirting with the sisters and going to the
theatre; and I fancy he does more of that than preaching. But
she seemed to think it was all the wife’s fault, and blamed her.
I asked her if she would like to be treated so, if she were
an Elder’s wife, and had to work as hard and endure as much
as all the Missionaries’ wives do. But she said she never
could be in such a position, and told me that I was not a good
Mormon or I would not set myself up as the accuser of the
brethren. But I ask you, Sister Stenhouse, if that is the
Mormonism which the elders used to teach us?</p>

<p>“And now I have told you all our long talk together, and
so you can judge for yourself what a change has taken place
since you left.</p>

<p>“The same day, after dinner, Brother Snow called, in company
with two other elders, to see Mrs. Elsworth, and to ask
her and the girls to a tea-party the next day. Mrs. Elsworth
declined; but one young lady would go with Brother Snow,
and Miss Caroline went with another elder; and my light-hearted
friend waited till <em>her</em> Elder came also to ask <em>her</em>.
After that, came Elder Shrewsbury, and I, of course, was to
go with him.</p>

<p>“With all my faith, I am very much troubled about these
things. They are not right, I think. Why, scarcely a day
passes but some of these elders, who appear to have very little
to do, call here, and send for one or two of these young sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and detain them from their work, much to the annoyance of
poor Mrs. Elsworth, who, I believe, will apostatize over it
eventually.</p>

<p>“See what a long letter I have written to you! I am
afraid it will tire you. I often long to have you here, that I
might come to you and tell you all my troubles. But perhaps
after all I am wrong, and ought to see things in a different
light. Have not the Elders and Apostles positively denied
that Polygamy or any other sin was practised in Utah, or
formed any part of the Mormon religion? and we know that
these men of God would not deceive us.</p>

<p>“Be sure, dear, to write a nice long letter to me <em>very soon</em>;
and, with fondest love, remember your own</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mary Burton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>I read this letter carefully through, and I sat down and
thought of dear Mary Burton, and felt deeply sorry that
she should be placed in a situation surrounded by so many
temptations. To myself the letter brought a sad confirmation
of all my fears. There was something painful in the thought.
Had Polygamy been openly avowed as a Mormon doctrine, I
should never have joined the Church. But now, what could
I do?</p>

<p>After three months’ absence, Mr. Stenhouse was to return
home, and I went to Geneva to meet him, feeling very happy
when I saw him once again. Numbers of persons, both in
Geneva and Lausanne had been converted while he was away,
and were waiting for him to baptize them—among them was
a retired Protestant minister, Monsieur Petitpierre, of whom
I have something yet to mention. We began at last to rejoice
in our success, and to be thankful that the Lord had answered
our prayers.</p>

<p>I was now more than ever anxious about Polygamy. From
much thinking on that subject, it had become the haunting
spectre of my existence, and I dreaded what every day might
bring forth. The news which my husband brought with him
by no means reassured me. He told me that he had heard
in England from the American Elders that there was a
general expectation among the Saints in Utah that at the
October Conference in Salt Lake City, Brigham Young would
publish to the world that Polygamy was a doctrine of the
Mormon Church.</p>

<p>After all the prevarications and denials then of the Apostles
and Elders, Polygamy among the Saints was really a fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
As the truth became clearer to my mind, I thought I should
lose my senses. The very foundations of my faith were
shaken, and not only did I feel a personal repugnance to the
unholy doctrine, but I began to realize that the men to whom
I had listened with such profound respect, and had regarded
as the representatives of God, had been guilty of the most
deliberate and unblushing falsehood; and I began to ask
myself whether, if they could do this in order to carry out
their purpose in one particular, they might not be guilty of
deception upon other points? <em>Who</em> could I trust now? For
ten years the Mormon Prophets and Apostles had been living
in Polygamy at home, while abroad they vehemently denied
it, and spoke of it as a deadly sin. This was a painful awakening
to me; we had all of us been betrayed. I lost confidence
in man, and almost began to question within myself whether
I could even trust in God.</p>

<p>There was no argument between Mr. Stenhouse and myself.
It would have been worse than useless, for it was not his doing,
and he assured me that he had as great a repugnance to the
doctrine as I had. He had at first only hinted that it <em>might</em>
eventually be acknowledged by the leaders of the Church; but
it was a matter of too deeply a personal character for me to
keep silence, and I did not rest until he had told me all. He
had not seen the revelation, but the information which he had
received was beyond a question; and singularly enough Elder
Margetts, the London Elder of whose flirtation in Southampton
I have already spoken, was at that time on a visit to Switzerland,
and confirmed all that my husband had said. Thus the
very man who, two years before, first excited my suspicions,
now confirmed my fears, and openly stated as a fact that which
he then was ashamed almost to suggest.</p>

<p>Elder Margetts had been in Utah from the time I saw him
in England, and was now on a mission to Italy. He knew,
therefore, very well what was said and done among the Saints
in Zion. I, and those like me, whose faith was not too strong,
were spoken of as “babes” to whom milk only must be given;
and in this way any deception necessary to quiet our tender
consciences was allowable; but Elder Margetts was one of
the “strong men,” to whom meat was necessary—in other
words, they were initiated into all the mysteries of the
faith.</p>

<p>My husband enjoined me not to speak of what I had heard,
and I felt very little inclination to do so—my heart was too
full. The pleasant dreams and hopes of life were ended now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to me. What could I look forward too? Henceforth the stern
realities of a lonely and weary existence were all the future
that should be mine.</p>

<p>Still, the “Revelation” sanctioning a change in the doctrines
and practice of the church, was not yet published; and until
polygamy was openly avowed I felt that the doom of my happiness
was not yet sealed; and like many another heart-broken
woman, I hoped against hope.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REVELATION ON “CELESTIAL MARRIAGE.”</span></h2>

<p>And time flew by; and at length the dreaded Revelation
came.</p>

<p>One very pleasant morning, early in January, 1853, two
Elders of the Italian Mission, Jabez Woodward and Thomas
Margetts, took breakfast with us; and with them also was
Mons. Petitpierre from Geneva, the Protestant minister of whom
I have already spoken. While I was busy preparing the meal,
Mr Stenhouse and the two English elders went to the post
office to get their letters, for at that time they were expecting
important news. When they returned, breakfast was quite
ready, and they took their seats at the table. I asked if there
were any letters from England; and my husband said, “No,
no letters; but there is a <cite>Star</cite>, and it contains the Revelation
on Polygamy.”</p>

<p>He handed me a copy of the <cite>Millennial Star</cite>, a Mormon
paper published in Liverpool; and as I took it, I felt as if I
were receiving my death-warrant. It was indeed the death-warrant
to all my hopes of happiness. I rose from the table,
asking them to excuse me; and overcome with agitation and
conflicting emotions, I retired to my own chamber. There, for
the first time, I read that document which has since brought
such sorrow and misery to so many wronged and heart-broken
women. The reader may perhaps like to see the only foundation
and authority for the practice of polygamy ever produced
by the Mormon leaders. So I copy <em>exactly</em> from the <cite>Millennial
Star</cite> what I then read, leaving out only a few lines here
and there, which had no special reference to the subject, but
helped to swell the size of the “Revelation:”—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">CELESTIAL MARRIAGE:</p>

<p class="center">A REVELATION ON THE PATRIARCHAL ORDER OF MATRIMONY,
OR PLURALITY OF WIVES.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Given to Joseph Smith, the Seer, in Nauvoo, July 12th, 1843.</i></p>

<p>1. Verily, thus saith the Lord, unto you, my servant Joseph,
that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand, to know and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob; as also Moses, David, and Solomon,
my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their
having many wives and concubines: Behold! and lo, I am the
Lord thy God, and will answer thee as touching this matter:
Therefore prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions
which I am about to give unto you; for all those who
have this law revealed unto them must obey the same; for
behold! I reveal unto you a new and everlasting covenant, and
if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one
can reject this covenant, and be permitted to enter into my
glory; for all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide
the law which is appointed for that blessing and the conditions
thereof, as was instituted from before the foundations of the
world: and as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant,
it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that
receiveth a fulness thereof, must and shall abide the law, or
he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.</p>

<p>2. And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law
are these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths,
vows, performances, connexions, associations, or expectations,
that are not made or entered into, and sealed, by the Holy
Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed both as well for
time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation
and commandment, through the medium of mine anointed,
whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and
I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power
in the last days; and there is never but one on the earth at
a time on whom this power and the keys of the priesthood
are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force, in and after
the resurrection from the dead: for all contracts that are not
made unto this end, have an end when men are dead.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>4. Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and
he marry her not by me, nor by my word; and he covenant
with her so long as he is in the world, and she with him,
their covenant and marriage is not of force when they are
dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore they are
not bound by any law when they are out of the world; therefore,
when they are out of the world, they neither marry, nor
are given in marriage, but are appointed angels in heaven,
which <em>angels are ministering servants</em>, to minister for those who
are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal
weight of glory; for these angels did not abide my law, therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly,
without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity, and
from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God for ever
and ever.</p>

<p>5. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife,
and make a covenant with her for time, and for all eternity,
if that covenant is not by me, or by my word, which is my law,
and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him
whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it
is not valid, neither of force, when they are out of the world,
because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by
my word; when they are out of the world, it cannot be received
there, because the angels and the gods are appointed
there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore,
inherit my glory, for my house is a house of order, saith the
Lord God.</p>

<p>6. And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife
by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting
covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of
promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed
this power, and the keys of this priesthood, and it shall be said
unto them, Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and
if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection;
and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers,
dominions, all heights and depths—then shall it be written in
the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder
whereby to shed innocent blood; and if ye abide in my covenant
and commit no murder whereby to shed <em>innocent blood</em>, it shall
be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath
put upon them, in time, and through all eternity, and shall be of
full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass
by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation
and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their
heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the
seeds for ever and ever.</p>

<p>7. Then shall they be gods, because they have no end;
therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because
they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things
are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because
they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>9. Verily, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according
to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit
of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting
covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they
commit no murder, <em>wherein they shed innocent blood</em>—yet they
shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their
exaltation, but <em>they shall be destroyed in the flesh</em>, and shall be
delivered unto the buffetings of Satan, unto the day of redemption,
saith the Lord God.</p>

<p>10. The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not
be forgiven in this world, nor out of the world, is in that ye
commit murder, wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent
unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting
covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this
law can in no wise enter into my glory, but shall be damned,
saith the Lord.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>13. God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to
Abraham, to wife. And why did she do it? Because this
was the law. And from Hagar sprang many people. This,
therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises.
Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation? Verily, I
say unto you, <em>Nay</em>; for I, the Lord, commanded it. Abraham
was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was
written, Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not
refuse, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</p>

<p>14. Abraham received concubines, and they bare him children,
and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because
they were given unto him, and he abode in my law. As Isaac
also and Jacob did none other things than that which they
were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according
to the promises, and sit upon thrones; and are not
angels, but are gods. David also received many wives and
concubines, as also Solomon, and Moses my servant; as also
many others of my servants, from the beginning of the creation
until this time; and in nothing did they sin, save in those
things which they received not of me.</p>

<p>15. David’s wives and concubines were given unto him of
me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the
prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these
things did he sin against me, save in the case of Uriah and his
wife; and therefore, he hath fallen from his exaltation, and
received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the
world; for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>16. I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant
Joseph, an appointment, and restore all things....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood,
wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you
all things, in due time.</p>

<p>17. And verily, verily I say unto you, that whosoever you
seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you
bind on earth, in my name, and by my word, saith the Lord,
if shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and whosoever sins
you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the heavens;
and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in
heaven.</p>

<p>18. And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will
bless, and whomsoever you curse I will curse, saith the Lord;
for I, the Lord, am thy God.</p>

<p>19. And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph,
that whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give
any one on earth, by my word, and according to my law, it
shall be visited with blessings.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>20. Verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto mine
handmaid Emma Smith, your wife ... let mine handmaid
Emma Smith receive all those that have been given unto my
servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me;
and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure,
shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God!... I give unto
my servant Joseph, that he shall be made ruler over many
things, for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from
henceforth I will strengthen him.</p>

<p>21. And I command mine handmaid Emma Smith to abide
and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if
she will not abide this commandment, she shall be destroyed,
saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy
her if she abide not in my law; but if she will not abide this
commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for
her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him, and multiply
him, and give unto him a hundredfold in this world, of fathers
and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and
children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.
And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant
Joseph his trespasses, and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses,
wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the
Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her
heart to rejoice.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>24. And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
If any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another,
and the first give her consent; and if he espouse the second,
and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then
is he justified. He cannot commit adultery, for they are given
him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth
unto him, and to none else; and if he have ten virgins given
unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they
belong to him; and they are given unto him—therefore is he
justified. But if one or other of the ten virgins, after she is
espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery,
and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to
multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment,
and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father
before the foundation of the world; and for their exaltation in
the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for
herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be
glorified.</p>

<p>25. And again, verily, verily I say unto you, if any man
has a wife who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches
unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these
things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, or she
shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy
her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive
and abide in my law. Therefore it shall be lawful in me, if
she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever
I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did
not believe and administer unto him, according to my word;
and she then becomes the transgressor, and he is exempt from
the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according
to the law, when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to
wife. And now, as pertaining to this law: Verily, verily I
say unto you, I will reveal more unto you hereafter; therefore,
let this suffice for the present. Behold, I am Alpha and
Omega. Amen....</p>

</div>

<p>And this was the Revelation!—this mass of confusion,
cunning absurdity, and falsehood. <em>This</em> was the celebrated
document which was henceforth to be law to the confiding men
and women who had embraced Mormonism! Looking at it
now—noting its inconsistencies and its flagrant outrage upon
common decency and morality, I can hardly credit that I should
ever have been such a silly dupe as to give it a second thought.
And yet, what <em>could</em> I do? I was bound hand and foot, as it
were, and my very vision itself was distorted. Unquestioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
obedience, we had been taught, was the highest virtue; rebellion
was as the sin of witchcraft. I had been convinced of
the truth of some of the tenets of the Mormon faith; and confident
in them, I accepted without question all the rest. Never,
till the possibility that polygamy might some day be acknowledged
by the Church, began to be whispered among the
Saints—never did a solitary doubt respecting my religion intrude
itself upon my mind; and after my apprehensions were
fairly aroused by those rumours, whenever I felt the faintest
shadow of unbelief or suspicion arising in my heart, I banished
it as an unholy thing. The time had not yet come when I
could judge dispassionately: the Revelation aroused within
me feelings of horror and dismay, but I did not dare to question
its authenticity. It brought bitterness to my soul, but I
believed it was from God, and that I must learn to bear the
cross patiently.</p>

<p>I did not at that time read the document through from
beginning to end. No; my indignation was such that before
I had read half of it I threw it from me in anger. Perhaps if
I had read it all, and considered it carefully, my own judgment
and my sense of right and wrong might have pointed
out its absurdity and wickedness. But I was far from being
tranquil enough to think calmly. I felt bitterly that this new
doctrine was a degradation to woman, and I wondered why God
should see fit to humiliate my sex in this way. I was willing
to devote myself, my life, my all to His service, but wherefore
should He doom me to everlasting sorrow?</p>

<p>What now was to be a woman’s lot among the Mormons?
A life without hope! Who can express the terrible meaning
of those words—<em>without hope</em>? Yet so it was. Hereafter
our hearts were to be daily and hourly trampled upon; the
most sacred feelings of our sex were to be outraged, our affections
were to be crushed. Henceforth we were to be nothing
by ourselves; without a husband, we were told, we could not
even enter heaven! But had our trials been limited to this
life we might have borne them, as many a weary soul has
done, waiting for the relief of death. But death was to bring
no hope to us; we were told that in the other world polygamy
should be the only order of marriage, and that without it none
could be exalted in glory. We were told these things by men
who we believed were true and holy men of God; and we
trusted in them.</p>

<p>Rebellious I felt, indeed, as I paced the room after I had
thrown the Revelation on the ground: I almost felt as if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should lose my reason. A woman in the time of trouble
always looks to some one in whom she can confide; but to
whom could I turn for one kind or cheering word? <em>who</em> would
comfort me? I had neither relation nor friend to whom I
could speak of <em>this</em> trial; there was no one who could understand
me. I could not turn to my husband in <em>this</em> sorrow, and
I dared not even kneel to my God to implore His aid. It was
He, they said, who had declared this Revelation was His will;
how then could I turn to Him? No; my heart sank within
me; henceforth there was to be no hope, no peace, for me!</p>

<p>There was a knock at my chamber door, and my husband
came in. He knew how acutely I must feel, and he came to
comfort me. I was almost choked with emotion and tears,
but he threw his arms round me tenderly, and spoke to me as
if I had been a child that needed consolation. He tried to
persuade me that God as a loving Father could never have
intended the pain or misery of His children, and that when
we came to understand the doctrine better, we should find that
all would be well. He spoke also of his own unchanging
attachment; and appealed to me whether I thought he could
ever love me less, or place his affections on another.</p>

<p>I tried to believe, and when I felt a little better I went with
him to the breakfast-room, where the others were waiting for
us.</p>

<p>We were not a very entertaining party that morning. The
Elders present of course knew what had kept me in my room,
and their attempt at cheerfulness was not very successful.
My husband was in sympathy with me, and I have no doubt
that I looked sad enough. There was only one person present
who did not appreciate the situation—Monsieur Petitpierre,
the Protestant minister—and they handed the Revelation
to him. Mr. Stenhouse and the other Elders had some
misgivings as to how he would receive it, and they were
afraid it might disgust him with Mormonism. But the old
gentleman stood the test bravely; and I saw then, as I have
seen since, that men can be easily satisfied that the Revelation
on Polygamy, or <em>any other</em> revelation, is divine, if they desire,
it to be so.</p>

<p>Here was old Monsieur Petitpierre, a man of more than
threescore years, and childless. To him the example of
Abraham and Solomon appeared most instructive—an example
which might be followed with advantage. His wife, like
Sarah of old, had never been called by a mother’s name; and
now, although thus far he had no idea who might act the part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of a second Hagar, there seemed a fair chance that a little
Ishmael might perpetuate the race of Petitpierres on earth, if
only the Revelation was acted upon by the faithful.</p>

<p>“It ought to be prayerfully thought of,” he said.</p>

<p>Prayerfully thought of! Poor, silly old man! Before then
I had respect for his years and learning; but now—what
could I think of a man who talked such nonsense? Had the
Revelation told him that the wife of his youth, now tottering
in step, and with hair silvered by age, was commanded to take
two or a dozen young husbands—I wondered whether he
would have added with such satisfaction “It ought to be
prayerfully thought of!”</p>

<p>From that day I learned to regard polygamy as an essential
part of the Mormon faith, and such for many years the world
has considered it; but when I first joined the church, such an
innovation would have appeared to the European Saints
beyond the wildest fancies of a dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">MISSIONARY WORK—TEACHING POLYGAMY.</span></h2>

<p>I now entered upon a new phase of my missionary life; the
Elders assured me that it was my duty to teach polygamy to
the women of Switzerland.</p>

<p>Hitherto, although I had suffered much from poverty and
privation, my work as a missionary had been very pleasant.
I believed with my whole heart all that I taught, and my best
wishes for the people around me were that they might become
altogether such as I was, except in my sufferings.</p>

<p>Now, however, all this was changed. It was no longer salvation
through faith in Christ, or repentance, or baptism; it
was no longer love and peace for this world, and the promise
of everlasting joy in the world to come, that I was called upon
to teach. My task hitherto had been a labour of love; now
it was to be a weary work of pain. How could I teach the
sisters, the affection of whose guileless hearts I had won to
myself—how could I teach them that which my own heart
abhorred, a doctrine which I hated with my whole soul!</p>

<p>How I strove against my rebellious nature! how I battled
with myself! That God had sent the Revelation I never
questioned, and all rebellion to His will I knew must be
sinful. I had no thought of evading the responsibility; my
heart must be subdued. It might be subdued; it might be
crushed and broken; but I could never again, I felt, be
truly happy. I tried to reason with myself, and to persuade
myself that it was I who was to blame and not the Revelation.
If the Lord required me to submit, it must be for some good
purpose; and I must not refuse the cross that He called upon
me to bear. Sometimes for a few moments something would
attract my attention and divert my thoughts; but the terrible
reality—polygamy, refused to be ignored, and I felt all
the more bitterly afterwards. I never was happy, for
life had lost its charm to me. Ere I slept at night one
dreadful thought was haunting my pillow—it disturbed my
very dreams; and when I awoke in the morning, it was with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a feverish apprehension of coming evil hanging over me. All
through the long, weary day it haunted my footsteps like a
spectre; and like a fearful blight that had fallen upon me, it
seemed to be withering my soul. One thought was ever
present in my mind—that thought, polygamy!</p>

<p>It can be no wonder that I lost all interest in life, and that
I should almost wish to die rather than live that life of degradation
which I dreaded would be mine. But death flies from
those who woo her; the wretched, the weary, the hopeless,
they find her not. I felt that there was no rest for me. My
only comfort was in my children; no revelation, I felt, could
change their relationship to me. But over my little daughter
Clara I mourned, for I thought if this revelation were acted
upon by the Saints, as doubtless it would be, she would some
day be called upon to suffer as I did. How little did I then,
however, anticipate in what way my fears would be realized!
My Clara became the daughter-in-law of Brigham Young,
having married his eldest son, Joseph A. Young.</p>

<p>I am afraid at that time I was somewhat of a trial to my
husband, for my heart was not yet quite subdued. I grew
impatient at the wrong which I felt had been done to me, and
I often said bitter things against the Prophet of the Lord and
all his sex, including my husband, who was then, and for years
after, a devoted Mormon, and was quite horrified at what I
said. He often told me that I was a great hindrance to him,
and that it was impossible for any one who lived with me to
enjoy the Spirit of God—and I was afraid that he only spoke
the truth.</p>

<p>Then I repented, and sought to chasten myself; and I
fasted and prayed, and asked forgiveness of God and my husband.
But even when most subdued I was as unhappy as
ever, and some one was sure to say something which reminded
me of my trouble; and whenever the elders came to the house
they were sure to discuss the one painful topic. Then my
indignant feelings all came back again, and I felt the spirit
of rebellion stirring within me. I could not help it, for
I felt that woman’s nature itself was insulted by the degrading
doctrine, and any mention of it excited my anger.</p>

<p>My husband and the Elders had anticipated that I would
not readily submit, and they bore with me as patiently as they
could, losing no opportunity of strengthening me in the faith,
ever keeping before me the obligation that rested upon me in
particular to explain the doctrine to the Swiss sisters. They
knew very well that nothing tends more to confirm the faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of the wavering than setting them to teach others. Brigham
Young has always acted on this principle, and whenever
any of the brethren have evinced signs of doubt or disaffection
they have been at once despatched on a mission. Their
efforts to convert others established their own faith.</p>

<p>Among the Swiss we had never spoken on polygamy or
any kindred subject, and we were therefore spared the
humiliation which the British Elders experienced in having
to retract their own teachings. Nevertheless, Mr. Stenhouse
and the other Elders felt great anxiety as to how the
new doctrine would be received. My husband did not at
once openly tell them that such a Revelation had been sent
from Zion; but whenever an opportunity presented he took
them aside singly, and spoke to them about the ancient patriarchs
who practised polygamy; and so great was his influence
with the converts that he soon won them over to the new
teaching, and made them feel that they would not be justified
in rejecting the Revelation. Many of the Swiss Saints
before their conversion had been more Socialists than Christians,
and they probably thought that this change in the
marriage institution was a sign of advancing intellectual
supremacy; but their wives were very far from sharing these
opinions with them.</p>

<p>After many days and nights of prayer and fasting I prepared
myself for my work. To a certain extent I had brought my
own self under control—or I thought I had; and I almost felt
anxious to begin, so that I might get over the painful scenes
which I fully anticipated. It was agreed that Madame Balif,
of whom I have already spoken as being rather sceptical when
my child recovered from her critical condition, should be the
first to whom the intelligence should be imparted, for it was
thought that if she accepted this Revelation without much
difficulty, the other sisters would be more easily won over.
She was a well educated and intelligent woman, and had seen
a good deal of the world. She had met her husband while
travelling in Russia, had married him, and they had returned
to their native land. She was in every respect a lady, but
she was a spoilt child, and had her whims; and she possessed
a great influence over the minds of the other sisters. On this
account it was that she was selected as the victim to whom
should be first imparted the mysteries of the Revelation, for
it was thought that whatever reception she might give to
polygamy, her views would greatly influence the conduct of
the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>As I before mentioned, Madame Balif and her husband
were models of affection to one another, and it seemed to me
quite a sin that I should introduce into such a household a
doctrine which could only produce disunion and misery. I
had, however, schooled my heart to what I thought was my
duty, and I strove to smother the rebellion rising within me.
But, after all, it seemed to me hardly fair that I should be
selected for this painful task. These husbands had not
courage enough, or were ashamed, to tell their own wives
about this wonderful Revelation; and so I, a weak woman,
hating in my heart the doctrine as much as a woman could
hate—<em>I</em> was chosen to introduce this pleasant subject, and to
persuade those I loved to their own ruin. I had had it all fully
explained to me, and I thoroughly understood the <em>beauties</em> of
the system in the sight of the elders, and what they considered
the strong points in the Revelation;—but it is miserable work
to try to convince others of a thing that you yourself detest.</p>

<p>One day, quite unexpectedly to her, they had told Madame
Balif that a new Revelation had been sent from Zion, and
that I would explain it to her; then Monsieur Balif left the
house, and remained absent until the wife whom he so devotedly
loved should have heard this new thing.</p>

<p>Madame Balif came down stairs singing, in her usual gay
spirits, little expecting what she was going to hear; and
when she came to me I felt so unfitted for my task that I
dared not look her straight in the face, although she was my
dearest friend, and I had such an affection for her. I stood
there, pale and trembling, and she thought that I was not
well. I was not indeed well; I was sick at heart. Never
before had the face of a friend been so unwelcome.</p>

<p>She asked me what it was that I had to tell her; and when
I hesitatingly denied having wanted to speak to her at all, she
said she knew there must be something, as her husband had
told her so.</p>

<p>I hesitated still; but at last found courage, and told her all.
It was a cruel task to impose upon me. Day after day I had
observed her and her husband, I had noticed their deep affection;
had seen her watching at the window for his return;
and he would come with a little offering of choice fruit or
flowers; and I thought no woman could be happier than
Madame Balif. And now for me to so cruelly awaken them
from their dream of bliss!</p>

<p>She sat and listened eagerly as I told my story; and when
at length she began to understand what was meant by it, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
thought that I must be playing some unseasonable joke upon
her, and showed as much in her countenance. But when she
saw that I really was in earnest, she sprang up, and cried out,
“Oh, my God! what a beastly religion! How dared your
husband and you come to us Swiss with such a religion as
that?” My eyes sank before her as she turned on me with
mingled rage and disgust, as if she would wither me with her
contemptuous looks. I felt as humbled as if I myself had
been the author of the Revelation.</p>

<p>“And does my Serge believe this?” she cried.</p>

<p>I assured her that he did believe it, and she paced the room,
to and fro, as if she would go crazy; my heart ached for her.
She gave way to a perfect storm of rage, and then sobbed and
cried like a child who had lost its mother. I was silent, for I
knew how she must feel, and I felt that she would be relieved
by tears. I had gone through the trial all alone, without one
word from a woman’s heart that could reach my own. And I
tried to comfort her. I remembered how I had felt myself,
and I believed that thus it was now with her. In an instant,
when I first realized that polygamy had anything to do with
me, just as I have heard it said of dying men, all my past life
rushed to my remembrance, and every word or deed of love
therein, stood out in brightest reality. Thus I doubted not it
was with my friend. Every tender word which her husband
had ever uttered; every loving deed he had ever done, came
to her recollection with a ten-fold dearness as she realized the
horrors which awaited her in the future.</p>

<p>How little did we either of us imagine the story she would
afterwards tell me in Utah!</p>

<p>I tried to soothe her, and she threw her arms passionately
round me, and pressed me to her throbbing heart, and wept
again. She thought of her husband and her little girls. But
with all her fears she dreamed not how miserable was the life
before her in poverty and polygamy. She was herself handsome
in form and fair in feature; and, in the full enjoyment of
all that could be desired in her sphere of life, she was as happy
as a youthful wife could be. She pictured to herself a time—not
now, her Serge loved her too truly <em>now</em>—when her husband
might cast his eyes upon some blooming damsel, younger
than she was <em>then</em>, and might begin to take a nearer interest
in polygamy. She pictured him bestowing on the youthful
beauty the love and tenderness which he had always bestowed
on <em>her</em>; how his affections would die out towards her; how
her heart would be desolate and alone!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>I took her hand in mine and spoke very gently to her; and
when she was calmer, I talked to her more freely. We found
now, as we tried to look our common enemy in the face, how
strong a hold Mormonism had taken of us; and it is in this
that persons unacquainted with the Saints have so greatly misjudged
the women of Utah; they know how small a hold such
a religion—now they look upon Mormonism and polygamy as
identical—would have upon them; and they forget how all-absorbing
was our faith in Mormonism <em>without</em> polygamy. We
confided not wisely, but too well.</p>

<p>Had polygamy been an invention of our husbands, or a
system which they capriciously adopted, we might have been
grieved, but we should have known how to act, for we were in
a Christian country, where women had rights as well as men;
it was our own hearts which were traitors to us. We had
been taught to regard Abraham and Jacob, and David and
Solomon as types of holiness, as men who were fit objects for
imitation; and now it was proved to us, from Scripture, that
these men were polygamists, and yet were blessed by God;
and we were called upon to follow their example. Thus we
tried to crush out the remembrance of our own womanhood.
Had we but followed the light of reason which God had given
for our guide, we should have trampled in the dust that vile
burlesque upon the holy religion of Jesus called a “Revelation
upon Celestial Marriage.” As it was, the religious teachings
which we had received, both before and after we embraced
Mormonism, alike combined to blind us to the truth.</p>

<p>In this state of mind we knelt, and prayed for the Lord to
increase our faith in that very doctrine which in our hearts we
cursed and hated; and on our knees we wept again; and
natural feelings of repugnance mingled with an earnest struggle
to submit to the will of God. Madame Balif had not so much
faith in Mormonism as I had, and she had consequently less to
trouble her in that respect; but she loved her husband, and
she knew that he was determined to go to Zion as soon as he
could; and then not only would all the luxuries of a happy
home be sacrificed, but all her anticipations of the future were
overshadowed by a terrible apprehension. Thus we were
equally troubled, though I had to endure most, as the task of
teaching fell upon me. I did at last manage to persuade her
not to offer any active opposition to the Revelation, but I could
not satisfy her that all was right. She even went so far as to
promise to try to overcome her own feelings, for if it was really
true she did not wish to be found fighting against the Lord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
She had, however, hardly ceased speaking when the thought
of her little daughters crossed her mind, and once more she
paced the room like an enraged tigress, declaring angrily that
“no vile polygamist should ever possess either of her sweet
girls.” I had felt like this for my own darling Clara.</p>

<p>I had now a companion in misery, some one who could
sympathize with me. Even had my husband detested the doctrine
as I did, he could not have comforted me as a woman
and a mother could. My poor friend could feel as I felt, and
her sympathy was very dear to me; misery loves companionship;
we were sisters in affliction. Not only so, Madame
Balif declared that this painful task should not rest on me
alone; she would help me in speaking to the sisters. Thus
we helped each other in the time of our trouble.</p>

<p>It must have been about this time that I received another
letter from Mary Burton. The postmark is quite indistinct,
but a week or two one way or the other does not signify
much. In her usual quick and impulsive way, she gave me
<em>her</em> views of the “beauties” of polygamy, and perhaps the
reader would like to hear what she said.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“ ... I am very miserable, Sister Stenhouse, and
furiously indignant. I little thought when I last wrote to you
that I should have such news to tell; but I suppose you know
it all without my saying a word. How we all felt when we
first learned that polygamy was true, no words of mine can
describe; we hardly dared look one another in the face. Let
me tell you how it was.</p>

<p>“One night, quite late, Elder Shrewsbury came round in a
hurry, and asked to see me. I went down into the parlour to
meet him, and Mrs. Elsworth came down also, and remained
until he went away. Elder Shrewsbury looked very strange
that night, just like a man who had been doing something
wrong and was ashamed of it.</p>

<p>“He excused himself for coming so late, but he said he had
only just received some important news, and could not rest
until he had seen us. He had been round at the Conference
house, and had there seen a good many of the Elders. They
were all talking earnestly upon the same subject, for that day
they had received, not only letters from the apostle at Liverpool,
but also copies of the <cite>Millennial Star</cite>, with the Revelation
in it, which I suppose you have seen. Of course it was
impossible for them to doubt any longer, but most of them felt
it was a cruel blow. Elder Shrewsbury said they looked at
one another, but did not dare to speak. Nearly all of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
had been anxiously trying to get rid of the false scandal, as
they supposed the accusation of polygamy to be; and in public
in their sermons, and in private to all the weak brethren, they
had over and over again solemnly declared that polygamy was
unheard of among the Saints, that it was a Gentile lie; and
they had proved from the Bible, and from the Book of Mormon,
that a doctrine so sinful could never be believed or practised
by God’s people.</p>

<p>“Now all this would be thrown in their teeth. Those who
hated Mormonism would revile them for it, and, worse still,
the Saints themselves would despise and doubt them for the
falsehoods which many of them had innocently told. Who
could tell where all this would end? When they were found
to have been deceived in a matter like polygamy, about which
it was so easy to arrive at facts and certainty, who would trust
them concerning other doctrines, which depended upon their
veracity and testimony alone?</p>

<p>“Then, too, there was worse to be said about the American
elders and apostles. Who could believe that Orson Pratt or
Lorenzo Snow knew nothing of polygamy? And yet they
denied it in the most solemn way. And, oh, Sister Stenhouse,
think of the Apostle Taylor calling God to witness his truth
when he proved from the Book of Covenants that there was
no such thing as polygamy: and all the while he had himself
<em>five</em> wives in Salt Lake City!</p>

<p>“Elder Shrewsbury told us all this, but he spoke slowly and
disjointedly, like a man whose mind is troubled. He said he
hardly knew what he was doing. Then he gave Mrs. Elsworth
a copy of the <cite>Star</cite>, and he asked me, too, to read the Revelation
carefully before I condemned it.</p>

<p>“‘If the Revelation, as you call it, allows polygamy,’ I exclaimed,
‘I hate and despise it, and you, and Mormonism, and
all!’ I was quite in a fury, and I <em>did</em> feel as if I hated him then.</p>

<p>“He did not answer me; he seemed too cut up to utter a
word; but I did not pity him. I felt that men who would
write such a revelation as that for their own wicked purposes
deserved all the hatred which the cruellest heart could muster
up; they were loathesome to any pure-minded woman. As he
was about to leave he said mournfully, ‘Sister Mary, I know
you have good cause for anger; but be just. I have been just
as much deceived as ever you have been. It has unsettled all
my faith; even our best and most tried missionaries are
shrinking from it. Do not blame me for what I have not done.
I never deceived you about it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not answer him; and after a few moments he said,
‘Mary, I want to speak to you <em>alone</em> about these things. Can
I see you, to-morrow evening, if I call?’</p>

<p>“‘I wish you would not call me Mary any more, Elder
Shrewsbury,’ I said; ‘it is too familiar <em>now</em>. We have been
far too friendly; but, thank God, I have found out in time, and
know how to act.’ He went away looking most miserable.
Then I went to my own room, and tried to think the matter
out. If I were married, as you are, Sister Stenhouse, and if
my husband believed in the Revelation, I think I should go
crazy. As it was, I felt it terribly. You know, dear, I told
you that I <em>liked</em> Elder Shrewsbury very well, but nothing more.
Well, that was very true <em>then</em>, but now I know that it was
not all the truth. I take care that he shall never know what
I think of him, but I know that he is not the same to me as
other people. I do not think I love him; no, I’m sure I don’t
<em>now</em>; but I do feel a great deal of interest in him. That
night, however, I felt very mad at him. That he had been
deceived, I knew, and also that he must have felt sorry for
having deceived me; and, if he cares for me, he must have
felt uneasy for what I might say or do, now the doctrine was
proclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well, the more I thought of it, the more angry I became,
and I couldn’t sleep all night. The next morning I wrote a
little note to Elder Shrewsbury, saying that after all that had
happened I had fully resolved not to see him again. Many
of my friends, I said, were married, and could not help themselves,
but I both could and would. The Mormon sisters I
should ever pity and love; but as for the Mormon men, I
would never have anything to do with one of them as long as
I lived. I did not want to be unkind to him personally, but
I really could not trust any one now.</p>

<p>“Then I showed this note to Mrs. Elsworth, and asked her
to give it to Elder Shrewsbury that night when he came.</p>

<p>“He came, of course, and he came again and again; but I
would not see him; and I did not even go to the meetings for
fear of coming across him there. He had long talks with Mrs.
Elsworth, and tried to get her to interfere, and at last he sent
me a long letter, entreating me not to refuse him. I was cooler
now; and when Mrs. Elsworth said I ought at least to see him,
even if I dismissed him then, I agreed to do so, and the next
night he came.</p>

<p>“He was very humble that night. You know what torrents
of eloquence he pours forth about anything that interests him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and how earnest he is. But then all his eloquence had fled.
He hesitated and blundered, until I really quite pitied him.
He came and sat by me, and would have taken my hand, but I
would not let him. He did not tell me that he loved me, but
he spoke as if I were conscious of the fact; and you know, of
course, I couldn’t help feeling that he cared for me, whether he
spoke about it or not. He assured me over and over again
that though he had often heard the scandal, as I had done,
he did not for a moment believe it; he said that he should
<em>never</em> himself act up to the Revelation; that if he loved, it should
be an undivided and all-absorbing love; that he would rather
have less glory in eternity, with <em>one</em> whom he could idolize,
than obey the Revelation on Polygamy, and obtain a higher
position.</p>

<p>“All this time he hardly once looked at me, but when I did
see his eyes, they seemed very sorrowful and very earnest. I
confess to you that what he said made me feel very differently
for him. For a man of his ability and talents, who has such
an influence, and wins so much respect from every one he
meets, to be sitting there all bashful, like a naughty child,
before a young girl like me, and all because he loved me, made
me feel for him a pity which was very near to love.</p>

<p>“I told him that I had quite resolved, now that polygamy
was acknowledged, never to see him again, except as I might
see the other elders at meeting. I said I believed I was still
a good Mormon, as Mormons used to be; but I would never
receive polygamy, or be more than an ordinary friend to any
one who did believe it.</p>

<p>“After that I only saw him at the meeting. And, oh dear!
you should see what meetings we have now! Half the people
don’t attend, and everything is so cold and lifeless. Some of
our most earnest elders never come; and it is said among the
brethren that polygamy will produce the greatest apostasy which
the church has ever seen. Every one seems ashamed of it.</p>

<p>“And now, dear, I have written you a terrible long letter, but
you must please forgive me, for I have no one to whom I can
open my heart except to you. Kiss the babies, please, for me;
and write soon to your most affectionately loving,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Mary Burton</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Poor girl! I said, as I folded up her letter; but it is better
for her to suffer a little now, than for her to have been married
first, as I was, and then, when too late to go back, to have
polygamy announced as an article of faith.</p>

<span class="smaller">MORMONISM IN ENGLAND—PREPARING TO EMIGRATE.</span></h2>

<p>It was fortunate for the Swiss mission that the new converts
in general could not read any language but their own, and
thus were ignorant of the deceptions which the American
Elders had practised upon the people.</p>

<p>Monsieur Petitpierre, the Protestant minister who thought
that the Revelation ought to be “prayerfully considered,” was
the only one who understood English, and his knowledge was
very limited. His wife did not at all coincide with him about
the prayerful consideration of polygamy; she disposed of the
subject without any prayer at all; and it is to be regretted that
in this respect the whole body of the Mormon women did not
follow her example.</p>

<p>What arguments she used I do not know; but that they
were very much to the point no one can doubt, for they banished
for ever all thoughts of polygamy from her husband’s
mind. It was said among the Saints that she was very energetic
in her private discussions with her husband. But however
this might be, it is certain that Monsieur Petitpierre
resisted as long as he could, for the Revelation quite fascinated
the childless old man; and it is possible that he might have
held fast to the faith, but unfortunately, just then certain
documents and publications of the apostles, and a very large
amount of evidence respecting them and their doings, attracted
his attention. He was in the main a good and truthful man,
although of small mental calibre, and the deceptions and
contradictions which he discovered quite disgusted him.
His wife’s strong personal arguments gave the finishing blow
to his faith, and the spell was broken. The vision of a
modern Hagar and a little Ishmael vanished from his mind; he
apostatised—and Mr. Stenhouse lost the services of a very
useful translator.</p>

<p>When I heard that he had left the church, how I wished
that I could have followed in his footsteps! But apostasy
from Mormonism is only possible to two classes—the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
disciple, who has embraced the faith more from enthusiasm
than from conviction, whose experience is limited; and the
old disciple, who has entirely outgrown it, and has become disgusted
with it all.</p>

<p>I was neither of these. My faith was too firmly grounded
to admit of my giving it up. Though I hated polygamy, I
did not dare to question the divinity of its origin. I only
pitied myself and my sex for the burden which God had seen
fit to place upon us. I never for a moment supposed that
any man would have been so wicked as to fabricate a “Revelation,”
or so blasphemous as to palm it off in the name of
the Lord.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I hated polygamy in my heart. And my efforts in
teaching it only increased my hatred; for when I was gravely
told by the Elders that woman had been cursed in the garden
of Eden, and that polygamy was one of the results of
that curse—“her desire shall be unto her husband, and <em>he
shall rule over her</em>!”—I must confess that my heart within me
was rebellious. From my earliest childhood I had thought of
God as a father and a friend, to whom I might go and tell all
my griefs and cares; but now He was presented to me as a
hard taskmaster, not as a father or a friend.</p>

<p>I met with much kindness, but I did not meet with much
sympathy from the brethren. They could not understand
that opposition to polygamy was anything else than selfishness
on the part of the sisters; they did not comprehend
the feelings of a woman’s heart—its craving for some object
upon which to devote its whole wealth of love. They were
taught that theirs was a nobler position than that of the
sisters, and that women might consider themselves sufficiently
honoured in being allowed to become the mothers of their children,
and to help in building up <em>their</em> “kingdom.”</p>

<p>Of my missionary work in Switzerland subsequent to the
introduction of polygamy I will say but little, except that it
was too successful. The same sorrow and indignation which
Madame Balif had so forcibly expressed, were shown by
almost every new convert, and I had to bear the blame of
teaching such a doctrine. The sisters became unhappy, and
wished that they had died in ignorance of Mormonism; and I
felt humbled to the dust to think that I should be the innocent
cause of so much misery to others. I looked anxiously
for a change; but the only change which seemed probable was
that we might be permitted to emigrate to Utah—and there
was no comfort for me in that prospect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>We remained in Switzerland until the close of the year
1854, and through the unremitting efforts of my husband
Mormonism was introduced into six cantons of the Confederation.
Monsieur Balif became an indefatigable missionary,
as was also Governor Stoudeman; and to their liberality and
zeal Mr. Stenhouse was greatly indebted. With the aid of
Monsieur Balif, he established in Geneva a monthly periodical
in the French language, for the edification of the Saints,
besides publishing a book in reply to the attacks of the clergy,
and many minor effusions.</p>

<p>At that time there was great excitement among the Saints
in Utah. Brigham Young and his apostles were denouncing
the Gentiles in the most unmeasured language. As I write,
a volume of sermons delivered at that time is before me, and
I really can hardly credit that so much ridiculous nonsense,
bad grammar, and blasphemy, could ever have been uttered
in a public place of worship—yet it was so. The Saints
were told that in these last times all the vials of the wrath of
God were about to be poured upon the earth; wars and desolations,
anarchy and persecution, fire, pestilence, and unheard
of horrors, were to desolate all the world, until men should
call upon the rocks to hide them, and in the bitterness of
their souls curse the day in which they were born; death was
to be sought for, but not found. Believing, as they did, that
all this was true, it is no wonder that the Saints in Europe
were alarmed, and became anxious to emigrate to Utah, where
they were told they would be safe. A seven years’ famine
was said to be at the door, when a sack of wheat should be
sold for a sack of gold, and Gentile kings and princes were
to come and crouch to the Saints for a morsel of bread. The
very women in Zion were counselled to sell the ribbons from
their bonnets, to buy flour with the proceeds, and to hide it
away against the day of wrath.</p>

<p>The brethren and sisters in Switzerland who could dispose
of their property hastened to “flee to Zion.” Some did so at
a ruinous sacrifice. One gentleman, a Monsieur Robella, I
knew, who was part proprietor of a newspaper and printing
establishment. In a very short time it would have been
entirely in his own hands; but he sold out at a great loss,
dreading that the storm might overtake him before he reached
the “chambers of the Lord in the mountains,” as the Elders
called Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>The journey from Europe to Utah at that time occupied
six or eight months; it was a very tedious pilgrimage. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Swiss friends had first to travel to Liverpool; thence by sailing
vessel to New Orleans; by steamer up the Mississippi as
far as St. Louis; up the Missouri to the frontiers; and then
across the plains by ox-teams. Much of this distance had to
be travelled during the worst part of the year. They left
their homes while the Jura mountains were still draped in
snow; and those who escaped the ravages of cholera and the
perils of the ways, reached their destination just as the frosts
of winter were beginning to whiten the hoary heads of the
hills which stand about Zion.</p>

<p>All the Swiss pilgrims travelled together until they arrived
at St. Louis; there they separated, one party going up the
river, and the other making the journey overland. The
cholera attacked the latter party, and cut off the greater number
of them, and their bones now whiten the prairie.</p>

<p>The news of their death soon arrived in Switzerland, and
the people at Lausanne were exasperated against the Mormon
missionaries; and when my husband visited that place he
found it prudent not to remain long. At the same time those
of the Saints whose relations had perished in the emigration
were pained to hear that it was because they “had not obeyed
counsel,” and gone up the river with the other party, that they
fell by the way. And, as if in mockery of this statement, the
next news that we received was that a Missouri steamer, on
board of which were many Mormon missionaries—all most
obedient to counsel—had been blown to atoms. Many of the
Saints began to consider these things, and their love waxed
cold.</p>

<p>Through all this our position was anything but pleasant,
and my husband applied for permission to be released from
the presidency of the Swiss and Italian missions, in order
that he might “gather to Zion.” His request was granted;
and in the autumn of 1854 we bade a final adieu to Switzerland.</p>

<p>We might now be said to have <em>begun</em> our journey to Zion,
although we tarried long by the way, and several years
elapsed before we reached our destination.</p>

<p>When we arrived in London we obtained apartments in the
house of the President of the London Conference, and there
I had opportunities of observing the effects of the system
upon the English Saints. Elder Marsden, the president, was
a thorough Mormon, and a man who was very highly thought
of. He had been acquainted with all the apostles and high
priests who had resided in Liverpool—the great <i lang="fr">rendezvous</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the Saints in England; had been President of the Conference
there, and now occupied the highest position of the
European mission. He was a pleasant, intelligent man, who
in his day had done much to build up the church; but, like
his two predecessors, John Banks and Thomas Margetts, he
also apostatized from the Mormonism of later years. At the
time, however, of which I speak, he was considered to be of
good standing among the Saints.</p>

<p>Up to this time I had never seriously doubted my religion,
and I probably never should have done so had it not been for
the introduction of polygamy. But what I saw in London at
that time sadly shook my faith, and the stories which I heard
from Utah quite frightened me. Nothing, of course, was
openly said, and at first I disbelieved every evil report, until
at last it was impossible for me altogether to reject what was
told me. The testimony of an apostate or of a Gentile would
have been dismissed with contempt; but when we saw letters
from mothers to their children, and husbands to their wives—all
people of unquestioned faith, setting forth the troubled
state of men’s minds in Utah, expressing fears for their own
safety, and hinting at “cutting off” the transgressor, and the
doings of “Avenging Angels,” we could not cast them aside
with contempt. My views of the glories of Zion were changing;
henceforth I was never firm in the faith; I felt that
there was <em>something</em> wrong.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader may think that now I might have left
the church, and thus have avoided all those troubles which
awaited me in Utah. But let him remember that, although
my faith was shaken, it was not wholly destroyed. All that I
clung to on earth—my husband, whom I truly loved, and my
darling children—were part and parcel of Mormonism. I could
not tear myself from them, and isolate my soul from all that
made life worth having.</p>

<p>My unsettled state of mind, however, did not long remain
a secret. It was spoken of among the Saints, and I became
an object of interest. The pastor over the London and
adjoining Conferences was the son of one of the chief apostles
in Utah—a young man, whose good nature was far better
than his religion. He visited us very frequently, and used to
bring with him the distinguished American Elders who might
be visiting the metropolis. I have no doubt that they were
sincere in their desire to do me good; but it was not kind
attentions that I then needed, it was the removal of the cause
of my sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>They tried to persuade me that it was all “the work of the
Lord;” but I could not see it in that light, and very often in
reply to their consolations I said very hard things of polygamy
and the leaders of the church, whose conduct I considered
sinful. And in this I did not stand alone, for I soon
found that the President of the Conference, Elder Marsden,
had been in the same position for years, and his wife was
“quite through” with Mormonism. In fact, so great had
been the distrust occasioned by polygamy, that in the report
ending June 30th, 1853, it was stated that from the whole
British church, which then numbered very nearly 31,000 souls—1776
had been excommunicated for apostasy!</p>

<p>Of those who remained faithful I cannot give a much more
cheering account. The Elders who visited President Marsden
made as damaging reports of the condition of the Saints as
their worst enemies could desire. All that my young friend,
Mary Burton, had told me did not equal the truth of what I
saw for myself. No one had any confidence <em>now</em> in what the
Elders said; how could they be trusted after so many years
of deception?</p>

<p>The Elders who visited me and reasoned with me about my
want of faith, tried to persuade me to be baptized again.
Among the Mormons it is the privilege of the faithful to be
baptized over and over again, as often as may be needed, for
the remission of their sins, which are thus washed away, and
the penitent is enabled to start afresh. At that time of fearful
excitement in Utah, called by the Mormons “The Reformation,”
when people were being exhorted under terrible
penalties to confess their sins, many were so frightened that
they acknowledged themselves guilty of crimes of which they
had never dreamed, while at the same time many horrible and
detestable sins were brought to light. Brigham and the
leaders found that they were confessing too much—the sinners
were far more numerous than the godly. Brigham, with his
usual craft, soon found a way of escape; the people were told
to be baptized again, so that their sins being washed away,
they could truly say they were not guilty of the crimes of
which they might be accused.</p>

<p>I was not convinced, and did not see that I had anything to
repent of, but I was quite willing to be re-baptized if it was
thought proper. At the same time I stipulated that the President
of the Conference, Elder Marsden, should be baptized
with me. I felt that if I required re-baptizing, how much
more necessary was it for Elder Marsden to have <em>his</em> sins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
washed away also. I partly believed in the fearful stories
that I had heard from Zion, but it was <em>he</em> who had shown
them to me. The Pastor of the Conference gave no sign that
he suspected my meaning in wishing Elder Marsden to be
baptized at the same time as I was, though I believe he must
have formed a pretty shrewd guess. And so we two went
down into the water, but I am afraid that little of our sins
was washed away. Not long after, President Marsden apostatized,
and my heart remained as hard as ever. At least I
was frequently told so.</p>

<p>Poor Elder Marsden! He was branded with the most
opprobrious titles which Mormon ingenuity or malice could
fling against him: and yet I know of <em>many</em> men—not one
nor two, associated most intimately with Brigham Young
to-day, whose faith is not a whit stronger than that apostate’s,
who serve the Prophet because it is their interest to do so,
but who in their hearts no more believe in his high pretensions
than did James Marsden, the President of the London
Conference.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the season for emigration had again arrived,
and we were directed to hold ourselves in readiness to start.
Although by no means unexpected, this “counsel” to emigrate
came very painfully to me, for every step we took
towards Utah seemed to bring me nearer to the realization of
my worst apprehensions. I had lost my affection for Mormonism,
and my enthusiasm had now quite melted away.
But to refuse to go was altogether out of the question.</p>

<p>Two little ones had been added to our family in Geneva,
and a fourth was born in London, the Christmas Day after our
return from the continent. The foggy atmosphere of the
metropolis did not agree with them at all, accustomed, as
they had been, to the pure and bracing air of Switzerland,
and I soon had serious illness in my family. My second
little girl, Minnie, was so sick that we almost despaired of her
life, and the others required constant attention; while the
little baby boy, only a few weeks old, was seldom out of
my arms. Just then it was, when so very awkwardly
situated, that the notification came for us to set our faces
Zionward.</p>

<p>They chided us for our want of faith, because we did not
take our poor little sick child from her bed at the risk of life;
but I thank God now that nature was stronger than our fanaticism,
and that our little girl was spared to grow up a blessing
of which we shall ever be proud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, President Marsden came to me confidentially, and
told me that the brethren were determined that I should leave
England, and had counted upon my yielding in a moment of
despair. My husband was to be counselled to go without me
to Utah, if I persisted in my refusal. After he had left
London, Elder Marsden was to give me notice to leave his
house; and left destitute, and entirely among strangers, it was
thought that I should be only too glad to follow.</p>

<p>I cannot tell how indignant I was; I could not find words
sufficiently contemptuous to express what I felt; I reproached
Elder Marsden with cowardice for agreeing to such
an inhuman proposition, and I declared that I would not risk
the life of my child if an eternity of suffering awaited me.</p>

<p>My husband was absent when this took place; but when
he returned he approved of what I had done, and Elder
Marsden was consequently “counselled” to send us away.
The doctor warned us against the danger of exposing my
little daughter to the cold in removing her; but we had no
choice, for we were obliged to leave. Those were very painful
times. Constant watching and anxiety had undermined
my own health, and I fell ill. Even then, had we been left
alone we might have escaped much of our trouble; but the
incessant meddling of “counsel” was a perpetual irritation,
and we were completely worn out with annoyance.</p>

<p>A pleasant apartment at the west end of the town was
taken for me, by the advice of the medical man, and I was
removed thither with my baby. I was not equal even to the
task of taking care of that little thing, and had to procure the
assistance of a nurse; the other children were cared for by
friends. All that I needed was rest and tranquillity of mind,
and I soon began to recover strength, though far from well.
But this state of quietude was soon to be disturbed. Again
we were notified that the last emigrant ship of the season
was about to leave, and we must sail in her; and again we
were obliged to refuse. My husband telegraphed to the
Apostle at Liverpool that I was not well enough to travel,
and he was told to “bring me along, and I should get better.”
The Apostle (!) cared nothing for individual suffering
providing the ambitious plans of the priesthood in Salt Lake
City were carried out. But my husband, anxious though he
was to set out for Utah, and obedient as he ever was to
“counsel,” was not such a slave as they thought him, and he
positively refused to go. For this he was very much blamed,
and it was said that his own faith must be wavering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Since my arrival in London I had several times seen my
young friend, Mary Burton. She had, as she told me in her
letters, very greatly changed, for she had now become quite a
young lady. Still she retained most of her winning ways,
though her childish prettiness had given place to the more
mature beauty of womanhood; and when I saw her I was not surprised
that she should be an object of attention, or that Elder
Shrewsbury should have felt so deeply her rejection of him.</p>

<p>I also had a visit from another person, whom I little expected
to see. This was no other than Elder Shrewsbury himself,
who, I had been told, had left London some months before.
This, he said was quite true; he had left London, and
gone to work as a missionary hundreds of miles away; trying
to forget his disappointment, but to no purpose. His was one
of those natures which, though kind and considerate to every
one, are not ready to form hasty attachments, but which, when
once they do meet with an object upon which to lavish their
affections, became devoted in friendship and unchanging in love.
Their affections flow more deeply than those of most people.</p>

<p>Such was Elder Shrewsbury, and such I thought he would
always be; but what disposition, however good, can be relied
upon when influenced by religious fanaticism? He stood
before me, <em>then</em>, manly and upright in his bearing, truthful and
honest—a man who would have scorned evasion or deceit; and
his every thought of Mary was replete with tenderness and
love. And yet I lived to see that man again, in Utah—alas,
how changed a man!</p>

<p>Before we first left England I was acquainted with Elder
Shrewsbury, but not very intimately. We had had one or
two interesting conversations together, but I remembered
him chiefly in connexion with Mary Burton. It was about
her that he now came to see me;—he wanted me to talk to her,
and intercede with her in his behalf. But I was no match-maker,
and all my thoughts respecting love and marriage had
recently been anything but pleasant. I told him plainly that
I thought Mary had done quite right in refusing to see him,
and, in fact, declining to receive the attentions of <em>any</em> Mormon
man. I did not doubt his love for her at present, I said;
but no one could any longer rely upon a Mormon Elder’s
word. Years to come, when they had a little family growing
up around them, and when it would be too late for Mary to
repent of trusting him, he might suddenly be convinced of the
necessity of obeying the Revelation, and then what could she
do? No! Even supposing that she loved him, which, I said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was very questionable, it was better that she should suffer a
disappointment now, than have her heart wrung with cruelty
and neglect in after-years.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried, his eyes dashing with indignation; “do
you take me for a dog that I should treat <em>her</em> so?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I said, and tried to pacify him; “I do not think
anything bad of you, but I look upon you as a man who is in
love, and therefore blind. You think of nothing now but
Mary, and are willing to sacrifice everything, and to promise
anything, providing you can win her. But when she has
become your wife, if she ever does, and you have time to cool
down, you’ll begin to see things in another light. You’ll find
that she is only an ordinary woman, made of flesh and blood,
like all the other daughters of Eve, and with, I daresay, quite
as many whims, and fancies, and perverse ways as any of
them; and then, when she ceases to be ‘an angel’ in your eyes,
and becomes merely a woman, you’ll begin to assert your right
to think and judge for yourself, and very probably all your
former devotion to your religion will return.”</p>

<p>“Sister Stenhouse,” he replied, “you do not seem to have
a very high opinion of my constancy; but I can assure you
that I have given this matter my most earnest, prayerful
thought. My love for Mary I need not mention; my devotion
to my religion you only partly know. While we were
told that Polygamy was not true, no one could be more steadfast
in the faith than I was; and when the Revelation came, I
looked upon it as a blight and a curse to the Church of God.
And how well-founded my fears were, you can see from this
terrible apostasy which has come upon us. I almost myself
left the Church. Then I went to the Apostle, and I told him
how I was situated. I told him all about Mary, and my devotion
to her; that I wished to win her for my wife, but that I
knew she would not marry me if she thought there was the
shadow of a chance that I should live up to the Revelation. I
told him that I myself should be perfectly wretched in Polygamy,
and that it was impossible that I should love more than
<em>one</em>. The Apostle said that I was quite right in all this. We
had no proof, he said, in the Bible, that Isaac had more than
one wife, and he was accepted of God. He counselled me to
do all I could to win Mary, and told me that I might truthfully
promise her that I would never enter into Polygamy. But
Mary would not so much as listen to me; in fact, since then
she never would see me alone.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure,” I answered, “whether I am doing right;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
but I don’t mind saying to you that I think, from what I have
seen of Mary, that she does not dislike you; but she is a sensible
girl, and does not choose to risk the happiness of her whole
life.”</p>

<p>He was vexed with me for saying this. How could I suppose
that <em>he</em> would wreck her happiness? Was he not willing to
die if it would give her a moment’s pleasure? And much more
lover’s nonsense he talked.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">EMIGRATING TO ZION:—WE ARRIVE IN NEW YORK.</span></h2>

<p>The afternoon following, Mary herself came to see me, her
face all flushed with excitement, and eager to tell me something.</p>

<p>“Whom do you think I’ve been talking to, Sister Stenhouse?”
she exclaimed. “You’d never guess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s much need for guessing,” I said.
“Your face betrays the secret, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “perhaps it does, but you wouldn’t wonder
at it, if you only knew how very anxious I have been. All this
time I have kept my word, and I did not see him or speak
to him once, except at meetings, and not much then, and I
have been <em>very</em> unhappy. This afternoon I came round about
an hour ago to see you, and there on the step was Elder Shrewsbury.
He said he was here yesterday, and was just going to
call on you again, and then he asked me to go a little way with
him, as he had something very important to say to me. At
first I refused to go, but he wouldn’t listen to it for a moment.
So I went with him, and we have been talking ever since; or
rather he has been talking, and I have been listening to him.
I can’t tell you, Sister Stenhouse, all he said—you can guess
better than I can tell you. But I’m afraid I shall not be able
to keep my resolution much longer, for when we came back to
the door again he said he wouldn’t come in to see you now, and
when he begged me to let him call at Mrs. Elsworth’s to-morrow
night, I did not feel it in my heart to refuse him;—was it
very wrong of me to do so?”</p>

<p>Said I, “I’m afraid, Mary, my opinion would not matter
much either way; Elder Shrewsbury’s eloquence is the music
which you like best to listen to.”</p>

<p>She blushed, and came and sat down beside me, and we
talked together until the sun went down and my little room
was quite dark. I told her of my troubles in Switzerland, and
of the miserable effects of introducing Polygamy there; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she in return told me all her love affairs with Elder Shrewsbury
and of her resolution not to listen to him unless he solemnly
promised never to have anything to do with the hated
Revelation. Her faith in Mormonism itself had, as I expected,
been very severely shaken; and I think that had it not been
for my efforts to reassure her, she would have left the Church
at that time. Would to God she had.</p>

<p>After tea, she said, “Have you a copy of the Revelation
here, Sister Stenhouse? I want to show you some strong points
in it which I think will astonish you. I learned all about it
from Elder Shrewsbury that night when he came to see me,
and it was that that disgusted me with the whole affair.” We
searched through my trunk but could not find the document,
and I told her that I had not patience to read it quite through
when it was given to me, and that since then I was not sure
that I had even seen it. “Never mind,” she said; “I’ll bring
it with me when I come again.”</p>

<p>How often have I thought since how much depended upon
that trifling circumstance. Had we then together read over
the Revelation and noticed the “strong points” of which she
spoke, I believe my eyes would have been opened, and I never
should have submitted to the misery which I afterwards endured
in Utah.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1855 it was determined that a
company of Mormon emigrants, numbering several hundreds,
should leave Liverpool <i lang="fr">en route</i> for Salt Lake City; and for
that purpose a vessel was chartered early in November. This
was not the ordinary season for emigration, but there were
then in England numbers of the Saints, anxious to go to Zion,
but too poor to pay their passage all the way. It was thought
that when they arrived in New York they would have time to
earn sufficient to carry them on, and it was then supposed
they could join those who came over by the ordinary spring
emigration. My husband and myself were counselled to join
these emigrants in Liverpool and proceed at once to New
York.</p>

<p>The Mormons in London were very kind to us before we
left, and did all they could to help us in preparing for our
journey. A kinder people than the Saints in Europe could
nowhere be found. My husband had been directed to take
charge of the emigrants in the transit from London to
Liverpool, and consequently I received no assistance from
him. It seemed to me a very cruel arrangement for the

very person to whom we ought naturally to have turned for
protection; but what were the feelings of a weak woman
when they came in conflict with the “counsel” of inspired
Apostles?</p>

<p>We arrived at Liverpool the same evening, and there my
husband was relieved of the charge of the company, and some
of the brethren were appointed to see that the baggage was
safely transferred from the railway to the ship. Early
the next morning we went on board, and it was not long
before we began to experience the pleasures (?) of an emigrant
life.</p>

<p>Before we set out for Liverpool, I had been told that on
board ship I should be able to obtain all the “help” that I
might desire; and, anxious to provide for the comfort of the
children, I engaged the services of two young girls to look
after them and assist me generally. This was an imprudent
step, as I afterwards found to my cost; but at the time I
thought that I had made a very sensible arrangement. Help
being secured, my next thought was to get our berths fixed, so
that all might be ready before the rolling of the ship began.
My first inquiries were for our bedding; but it was nowhere
to be found. Now this was very annoying, for we were all
tired, and the children, poor things, were fidgetty; and anticipating
a long and unpleasant voyage, I wanted to have everything
in readiness. Besides which I had made special preparations
in the shape of many additional comforts which I knew
on board ship would be absolutely necessary, and had even sold
my watch and jewellery for that purpose.</p>

<p>I inquired of the proper authorities, but could obtain no
information, and nothing remained but for me to wait until the
Apostle came on board to bid a final adieu to the emigrants.
I felt this annoyance all the more, as I considered that we had
no right to expect such mismanagement. We would naturally
have preferred to make our own arrangements and to
go alone, had we been permitted to do so; but we had, over
and over again, been instructed not to go by any other vessel
than that chartered by the Apostle Richards, that so we
might escape the perils which were sure to overtake the Gentiles.
Imagine our disgust when we found that as there
were not enough of the Saints to occupy the whole ship, the
lower deck was filled with Irish emigrants of a very low
order, and that their luggage and ours had been thrown together
indiscriminately into the hold. Most of the Mormon
emigrants recovered their property when they arrived at New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
York; but as for our own, personally, we never saw it
again, and all the voyage through we were left utterly destitute.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but for me to put the best face I could
upon matters. I took my wearing apparel and other articles
out of the trunks and put them into pillow-slips, and extemporized
as well as I could a rough substitute for beds. These
served for the children, and I covered them with my cloaks
and shawls; and for our own berths and bed-covering I had
only a few pieces of carpet which I put aside for the cabin
floor, together with a worn-out blanket which an old lady on
board was good enough to lend me. This was our going to
Zion.</p>

<p>We had not been long at sea when the young sisters whom
I had engaged to help me fell sick, and some of the brethren
were very anxious to nurse them. This appeared to be quite
the established order of things, for I then found that it was
very seldom that a Mormon emigrant ship crossed the ocean
without one or more marriages on board. It was, no doubt,
very interesting to them, but to me it was extremely inconvenient,
especially considering that my husband had now taken
to his berth, which he did not leave during the remainder of
the voyage, and myself and the children were not much better
off.</p>

<p>Sick as I was, I had to prepare our food and manage everything,
for in those times emigrants either took out their own
provisions or were allowanced in raw material, and in either
case had to do their own cooking. My chief difficulty was in
getting what I had prepared to the fire-galley, for I could not
leave the children, and I was afraid to venture myself upon
deck. So I got any of the brethren who chanced to be passing
to take it up, and of course they were willing to oblige me;
but the galley was so crowded—every one having his or her
own interest to attend to—that I very rarely, if ever, had my
provisions decently cooked, and on more than one occasion I
never saw them again. This was an inconvenience which
emigrants do not suffer at the present day.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful with the young sisters, I thought I would try
if I could not get one of the brethren to help me, and fortune
at first appeared to favour me. There was on board a young
man—Harry they called him—and he was so situated that
I found it easy to open a negotiation with him. He had been
a saddler’s apprentice in a country town in England, and having
listened to some itinerant preacher, had been converted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
joined the Church, and began to think for himself. So hearing
that terrible judgments were quickly coming upon the
Old World, he resolved to flee to the New, and in his hurry
to get there he forgot to inform his master that he was about
to leave. This accounted for his being so badly provided
for.</p>

<p>Now, Harry had those two great blessings—a splendid appetite
and unimpeachable powers of digestion. I will not say
that he enjoyed these two blessings, for that he did not, on
account of lacking a third blessing, namely, the wherewithal
to make the first two blessings a pleasure, and not an inconvenience.
The ship’s allowance was altogether insufficient for
him, and he therefore gladly engaged to do what few things
I required upon condition that I should add a little to his own
private commissariat.</p>

<p>Harry was a smart lad and at first very useful, and he soon
convinced me that he had told the truth when he said that he
had not had enough to eat ever since he came on board—it
seemed to me very questionable whether he ever had before.
He had, however, nothing to complain of in that respect
while in our employment; for although the children were
able to eat whenever we had anything fit for them, my husband
and myself could seldom touch our rations, and as everything
that was not used fell to Harry’s share, he fared pretty
well.</p>

<p>Harry was not the lad to neglect his own interests, and
as our interests appeared just then to be his also, matters worked
very harmoniously. Our bread was never now brought back
to us half raw or burnt to a cinder. It must be properly cooked
for our eating or it would not do for Harry’s; and as for it
being lost or delayed on its way to or from the galley, that was,
of course, quite out of the question. But the strangest thing
of all connected with Harry was that immediately after his
coming we were incessantly annoyed by <em>the rats</em>. I had
brought for the children’s use a small supply of preserves and
other little delicacies; but these mysteriously disappeared
with alarming rapidity; and whenever I saved any trifle for the
children to eat between meals, that also was gone when it was
wanted, and in every instance Harry suggested that it was
“the rats,” though I never could find any traces of those interesting
animals. I was sorry to part with Harry, for he used
to tell funny stories to the children, and amused them a great
deal; but “the rats” and Harry were so closely associated in
my mind, that I thought if Harry left the rats might perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
also cease their visits. So Harry went, and I was once more
left alone to do the best I could.</p>

<p>The weather was very cold, and we felt its severity
very much. The rigging of the ship was hung with icicles,
and, without fire or warmth of any sort, it is no wonder that
we all were soon hardly able to move from cold and sickness.</p>

<p>In the midst of my trouble I was told of an ancient Scotch
sister—a maiden lady, sharp and shrewd—who, like the miser
in Scott’s “Fortunes of Nigel,” was willing to help us “for a
consideration.” It was agreed that she should give me her
services for the remainder of the voyage; and the “consideration”
was to be two pounds English. Small as was our stock
of money, and much as I knew we should need it upon our
arrival, I felt that I could do no better than engage her.
There was no saying upon whom <em>she</em> might chance to set her
maiden fancy, but there was not the remotest chance of any of
the brethren falling in love <em>with her</em>; so I considered her a safe
investment, and, besides, I must have <em>somebody</em>—there was no
alternative.</p>

<p>It was now Christmas time—a season sacred to joyous
memories and festivities; but to us, exiles and wanderers,
seeking a land of which we knew nothing, and which to us
was a new and untried world, it was far from being a happy
time. In the midst of the wild, dreary ocean there was
nothing to recall the pleasant reminiscences of the past, or to
inspire us with hope and courage as we thought of the
future.</p>

<p>The captain told us that we might prepare to eat our
Christmas dinner in New York; but he was mistaken in his
calculations. We did not eat our Christmas dinner in New
York, as he had promised. A storm came on, which compelled
us to stand out to sea again, and then a dead calm
followed, and it was not until New Year’s eve that we set foot
upon the shore of the New World.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">LIFE IN NEW YORK:—CONDUCTING A MORMON PAPER.</span></h2>

<p>Very cold, and dark, and dreary, were the first days which
we spent in the New World. That faith which once had
led me to hope, and believe, and “endure all things,” was now
powerless to nerve me to any new course of action for my
religion’s sake; for the dark shadow of Polygamy had come
across my way; hope had fled, and my love, with the love
of many other faithful Saints, had waxed cold.</p>

<p>To my husband and children I was, of course, devotedly
attached, and was willing to combat any difficulty or endure
any trial with them, or for their sake; and it was not long
before my constancy was put to the test.</p>

<p>The Mormon emigrants have always a Captain and two
“Counsellors” to every company. The Captain on board the
“Emerald Isle,”—the vessel in which we came—was a returning
Utah Elder;—one of his Counsellors was also a
returning Elder, and my husband was the other. As soon as
the Mormon Captain had come on shore, and had reported to
the Apostle in charge of the New York Saints, he left to visit
his friends. The Utah Counsellor had a young lady in the
company to whom he had become very much attached, and who
afterwards became one of his wives. I was not, therefore,
surprised that, as soon as he could get his baggage, he also
should disappear; but my husband—the other Counsellor—being
encumbered with a wife and family, was obliged to remain,
and the whole charge of seeing to the company devolved
upon him.</p>

<p>We had, therefore, to remain in Castle Gardens until the
whole company of emigrants was provided for; and during all
the next week I, with my four children, remained in that
public place, sick and weary, and as destitute of bedding and
covering as we had been on board ship. The weather was
intensely cold, and, unaccustomed as we were to the severity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of an American winter, we suffered not a little. The other
unfortunate victims to faith were in the same condition, with
the exception that they had something to sleep on at nights,
while I had nothing but the bare boards for my bed since we
left Liverpool;—all that I could gather together had been
reserved for my babes. How we lived through that journey
I know not, but I am certain that, could I have foreseen what
we should have to endure, I would never have left England,
whatever my refusal might have cost me.</p>

<p>I could not refrain from contrasting my life before and since
I knew Mormonism. Before, I scarcely knew what suffering
was, so little had I been called upon to endure. I never
knew what it was to be without money, or to want for anything;
but now I was in a strange land, in the depth of
winter, without a home, without a pillow to rest my weary
head upon, and with a future before me so dark that not a
single ray of light gave to it the promise of hope. Could any
slavery be more complete than mine? My fanaticism and
zeal were all gone—I had nothing to sustain me. Certainly,
I was still held by the fear that Mormonism, after all, <em>might</em>
be of God, and that all this suffering <em>might</em> be necessary for
my salvation—but if at that time I had only had a friend
whose mind was clear from all the nonsense of Mormonism,
and who had felt sufficient interest in me to advise me for my
good, I think even then I might have freed myself from the
mental slavery in which I was bound. But I had no intercourse
with any but Mormons; and, indeed, a wish to form
Gentile friendships I should then have considered a sin.</p>

<p>A week after our arrival, my husband found time to seek
for apartments for his family, and I was thankful to leave our
miserable quarters at Castle Gardens.</p>

<p>The Mormon authorities had, meanwhile, given instructions
to the other emigrants how to act, and they did little more
than this. Those who had not found work or places to go to
were ordered to leave the gardens, and received permission
to occupy an old dilapidated school-room in Williamsburgh,
which had been used for preaching. I went there almost
daily to see them, and therefore state what I saw as an eye-witness,
and neither exaggerate nor misrepresent. There they
huddled together, about one hundred and fifty—men, women
and children. Most of the men had been respectable mechanics
in their own country; many of them I had known
personally and had visited in their cosy English homes; and
their wives and families had been decently brought up. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
they must have suffered under this change of circumstances I
leave the reader to guess.</p>

<p>In that miserable place they lived day and night—the poor,
dispirited mothers (many of them very sick) having to cook,
and wash, and perform all the necessary domestic duties,
round two small sheet-iron stoves. It was not long before the
place became like a pest-house from so many being confined in
so small a place, and breathing the same fetid and pestilential
atmosphere; and many of the young children died of an epidemic
which was raging among them.</p>

<p>They had saved some of the ship’s provisions, and that
was all they had to eat, and it did not last long. To me it
was most distressing to witness so much misery without being
able to render any assistance, particularly to see the poor
little children shivering and crying with hunger and cold,
while many of their mothers were in such a miserable state
of apathy that they paid little or no attention to them. I
often tried to awaken in them feelings of human sympathy,
but I was met with a murmur of discontent. The people, men
and women alike—seemed to be utterly demoralized. Nor
can this be a matter of wonder; for in England the men had
been told that—while at home they could only earn four or
five shillings a day, and would never be able to put by enough
to carry them all the way to Utah—in New York they would
be able to earn two-and-a-half to three, and even four dollars
a day—equal to from ten to sixteen shillings English—and
that employers would even come on board ship anxious to
engage them. Thus they had by false statements been allured
from their homes and plunged into the most abject
poverty. Day by day they went out seeking work, but finding
none; willing to do anything to provide bread for their
families, but returning nightly, unsuccessful, to their starving
wives and children.</p>

<p>My own resources were gone. I could do nothing. When
we left Castle Gardens I think we only had about five dollars
left, while the heavy snow which covered the ground and
the intense cold promised many weeks of unusual severity.
Needing so greatly pity myself, how I sympathized with
those poor sufferers, how I pitied them!</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, the Apostle John Taylor learned
that some of these poor souls had been seen begging. So he
came from his comfortable boarding-house in Brooklyn, well
wrapped up in a handsome overcoat, and scolded these poor,
starving creatures, and harangued them concerning the meanness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of begging. With great swelling words he spoke of the
dignity of the Saints of the Most High, and told them that he
despised a Mormon who could fall to the level of a common
street beggar.</p>

<p>Could he have heard the unspoken curses of the poor,
wounded hearts of those who listened to him, as they thought
of his brother “Apostle” in England, and of how he had
deceived them and sent them into a strange country, in the
depth of winter, to beg, to starve, or to steal, he would have
learned that though the victim of a delusive faith may mentally
submit to man-made creeds and priesthoods, in his heart
he will judge, not so much the words he hears as the man
who utters them.</p>

<p>The wisdom of the Apostle found out a remedy. He
“counselled” the men and boys to buy shovels, and go forth
into the streets and clean away the snow from the fronts of
the doors and from the side-walks, and told them that they
would thus get plenty of money to keep them until winter
was over. One elderly brother, who had a little money left,
bought a stock of shovels; but the emigrants found that there
were plenty of others who were as eager as they for work, and
who were much better acquainted with the way of obtaining
it. The shovel experiment was a failure, and the poor old
brother lost his money in the investment.</p>

<p>For whatever the Apostle Taylor may have contributed to
these unfortunate persons—whether in “counsel,” money, or
provisions—he will doubtless have his reward; and, for aught
I know, he may have been unable to give anything more than
counsel; but, at the same time, my opinion of the value of
counsel remains unchanged. There has been no lack of
“counsel” or counsellors in the Mormon Church. “Counsel”
has been given in abundance to all, and by no means always
for the benefit of those who received it. It was not, however,
because he failed to assist them practically that the people
hated the Apostle Taylor, and have hated him ever since; but
it was for his pride and arrogance, and the way in which he
dared to talk to free-born Englishmen and Englishwomen
about the dignity of the Priesthood, and the contempt in
which he held them in the hour of their humiliation and distress—for
that they hated him.</p>

<p>I do not, of course, wish to justify the people in begging;
such conduct would have been despicable if they could have
found employment of any sort. But when I saw the starving
condition of those men and their helpless families, in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
wretched school-house, in my heart I almost honoured them
for having the courage to beg; and I thanked God that the
“mean Yankee Gentiles”—as the Elders taught the Saints to
call American citizens who did not believe in Mormonism—were
able and willing to assist them.</p>

<p>One of those emigrants very recently related to me some of the
painful circumstances through which he passed at that time.
He told me that he walked the streets of Williamsburgh for
three days and three nights without a mouthful of anything to
eat, or a place to lay his head;—he could obtain no work,
and at length, in sheer desperation, he was <em>forced</em> to beg.
The Church authorities knew well the misery of the people,
but took no adequate steps to alleviate it.</p>

<p>During the first weeks after our arrival in New York city,
we had nothing to depend upon but the provisions which we
had saved from the ship’s rations. I had known what it was
to be in a foreign country without money and without food;
and on board ship I took care of our rations when they were
not consumed by Harry or “the rats;” for I thought that if
I did not need them—which, indeed, I sincerely hoped might
be the case—I could certainly find some one who would be
thankful for them. These rations consisted chiefly of sugar
that was almost black; very bad black tea, which when made
looked like dye; the poorest kind of sea-biscuit; and other
things accordingly. The provisions for the Mormon emigrants
were purchased in bulk by the Church authorities, who
made their own profits out of them, and the Apostle at Liverpool
had the benefit of all that could be saved out of them
during the voyage. It was commonly said among the people
that the sight of them alone was quite sufficient for any one
who was not half-starved; and yet they had paid the price of
the best.</p>

<p>We had been in New York several weeks when one day my
husband called at the office of a paper called <cite>The Mormon</cite>,
and there met with the Apostle Taylor, who conducted that
paper. The Apostle expressed great regret that Mr. Stenhouse
should be without occupation at that season of the year,
and with a family of children upon his hands. This sympathy,
coming from a brother Missionary was, I thought, very tardy,
for my husband had then devoted over ten years of his life to
the cause, and his record in the Church had been untarnished.
The Apostle was living in an elegant house, surrounded by
every comfort and luxury, while he knew that we had not so
much as a chair, or even a bed to lie upon. What had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
done for the Church more than my husband had done? Indeed,
I firmly believe that he had not endured half so much,
but—he was an Apostle! His unhelping sympathy appeared
to me a little more than questionable.</p>

<p>He told my husband that he might come into the office of
<cite>The Mormon</cite>, and write the addresses on the wrappers, and
that he would give him a few dollars a week “to help things
along,” until something better presented itself. My husband
thought this a disinterested action on the part of the Apostle
John Taylor, but my experience in Mormonism led me to be
distrustful and suspicious of everything that an Elder or
Apostle said or did. This offer, however, came when we
really had nothing to look to, and dared not refuse any assistance
that was offered, however small it might be. But I must
admit that my ideas of Apostolic liberality were very much
shocked when at the end of the week Mr. Stenhouse informed
me that he had been allowed four dollars for his services, and
that out of that magnificent sum the Apostle John Taylor had
deducted twenty-five cents which sheer necessity had compelled
him to borrow for the week’s ferriage.</p>

<p>The Apostle-editor had two assistants from Utah with him
in <cite>The Mormon</cite> office—the one a “Seventy,” and the other
a “High-Priest”—terms and titles which I shall presently
explain. A few weeks after my husband entered the office,
the “Seventy” who had charge of getting out the paper was
allowed to return to Zion. The High-Priest remained in the
Eastern States visiting alternately the various branches of the
Church, and doing some very zealous courting with a young
English girl who lived in Williamsburgh, while his two unsuspecting
wives at home in Salt Lake City were earnestly
praying the Lord to bless him in his “mission.”</p>

<p>Whatever the Apostle may have thought of his associate,
he could not very well remonstrate with him, for he himself
was, and had been for some time, doing a good deal in that
line with an amiable Connecticut girl, and was only waiting
for special permission from Brigham Young, to add her to the
half-dozen wives he already had in Utah.</p>

<p>There was, moreover, another High-Priest attached to that
office, but no one seemed to understand his exact position.
To all appearance his principal occupation was travelling from
New York to Connecticut and from Connecticut back again
to New York. He was a very robust-looking man, but it
was reported that he was troubled with heart-disease, and that
the purer air of Connecticut was a great relief to him. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
I fully believed when, some time after, I discovered that the
young lady engaged to the Apostle had a charming sister,
for I thought it very probable that she rendered no small
assistance to the Connecticut air in giving relief to his diseased
heart.</p>

<p>My husband not being at that particular time under the influence
of “heart-disease,” soon became very useful on the
editorial staff. In fact, pretty well everything was left to
him, and not unfrequently for two or three days he saw nothing
of the Apostle or either of his associates, and the whole
responsibility of getting out the paper—at the magnificent
salary of four dollars a week!—rested upon him. He was
told that he must regard it as a mission, and be prepared to
act accordingly.</p>

<p>In course of time, however, the visits to Connecticut came
to an end. The Apostle obtained Brother Brigham’s permission
to practise a little Polygamy among the Gentiles, and
Miss Young made him an excellent housekeeper in a handsomely
furnished house in Brooklyn. The poor High-Priest and the
Seventy did not fare so well: they were expected to wait
until they reached Zion. The two young ladies to whom they
were engaged were amiable and good girls, who would without
doubt have met with excellent husbands either in or out
of the Church; but the name of an Apostle or High-Priest—when
the men themselves were away from home—carried
with it many charms, and won the hearts of the young ladies
and their friends. The Apostle was, of course, well used to
the training of wives in the “celestial order,” and when he
returned home with his youngest bride he suffered no particular
inconvenience. But the High-Priests realized the truth
of the adage “The course of true love never did run smooth.”
The first wife of one of them refused to have anything to do
with his new bride, and kept him at a respectful distance
from herself then and ever afterwards; while the first wife of
the other declined to acknowledge the claims of her youthful
rival. The first High-Priest has gone to heaven; the other,
in the course of time, gave a bill of divorce to his wife.
What happiness either of these three girls found in Polygamy
they best know, but the young widow appears decidedly
the happiest of the three.</p>

<p>I had heard much while in London about men taking
wives “from principle,” and that, after the first wife, they
made no open display of their love, but I could not see that
they differed in the slightest from their Gentile brethren in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that respect; the Utah Elders of whom I have spoken
always seemed to be very human. In all Polygamic courtships
that I have since witnessed, the brethren have appeared
to think that the “Lord’s” revelation was a trifle too slow in
arranging affairs of the heart, and they have been zealously
preparing for its coming. In some instances the revelation has
come too late, and in many others it would have been very disastrous
if it had not come at all. In all cases it may be safely
asserted that all that has been said about getting the consent
of the first wife and obtaining a revelation from the Lord as
to whether it is pleasing in His sight for a man to take
another wife, or not—is pure folly and nonsense. Brigham
Young is the only “lord” who has ever been consulted on
that question. If he acknowledged this to the people and
they chose to abide by it, they alone would be to blame; but
it is the grossest of frauds for men claiming to be the representatives
of Jesus Christ to play upon the credulity of an
honest people, trifling with the most sacred subjects, and telling
them that God answers by special revelation and declares
whether or not it is His will that each of these plural marriages
should take place. The Apostles and Elders themselves
are not deceived. They know well enough that
there is no truth in all this mockery; they know that the
only source of all their revelations is the man Brigham
Young.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SAINTLY PILGRIMS ON THE WAY—THE “DIVINE” HAND-CART
SCHEME.</span></h2>

<p>One Sunday morning in early spring I attended a meeting of
the Saints in Williamsburgh.</p>

<p>My husband was there, and took part in the service, and so
did the Apostle Taylor, and one or two other Utah Elders.
I went to that meeting in a very desponding state of mind,
for our prospects since the day of our arrival had not
brightened very much, and I felt the need of some comforting
and cheering words.</p>

<p>Whether it was the influence of the clear spring morning,
or that the Elders had noticed the depression of spirit among
the Saints, I cannot tell, but I know that on that particular
occasion their words seemed to me more earnest and encouraging
than they had been for a long time past.</p>

<p>As we came out from the meeting, Brother Benton, one of
the Elders, stepped up to my husband, and said, “Brother
Stenhouse, <em>they</em> are expected to arrive to-night or to-morrow;
I suppose you will be down at the ‘Gardens’ to meet
them.”</p>

<p>I knew well enough who “they” were who were expected
to arrive, and so did Mr. Stenhouse. “Yes,” he said, “of
course I shall be there, but most likely we shall have to wait
a few days before they come.” Then he stopped and talked
over the matter with Elder Benton.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that at that time Brigham Young was trying
an experiment. The “Prophet of the Lord” sometimes
finds it necessary—notwithstanding the “revelations” which
he is supposed to receive—to try experiments like other men
before he can feel sure that his plans are likely to succeed.
The only difference between him and other men is, that he—knowing
himself that his plans are his own inventions, or the
inventions of the leaders—gives out that they come direct
from God, thereby deceiving the ignorant, innocent, and confiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
people; and when his plans fail, as they often do, he
never confesses that he is wrong or mistaken, but lays all the
blame on some other person, or, failing that, on “the Lord”
or the devil. Other men, as a rule, say nothing about “the
Lord” or devil, but when their experiments fail they
frankly confess that they themselves were not inspired, but
were liable to err. That is all the difference.</p>

<p>In the present instance Brigham Young tried an experiment
upon a rather large scale.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1856 the Mormon emigrants made the
journey from the Frontiers across the Plains by ox-teams, as
I have already described, and every season some of the wealthier
Mormons formed themselves into an independent company,
paid their own expenses, and travelled with more comfort.
The expense to the poorer emigrants was very small,
for they performed the greater part of the journey on foot—the
ox-teams being used for transporting provisions and baggage—one
hundred pounds of the latter being allowed to each
emigrant.</p>

<p>This “plan” was, so far, a success, and the settlements of
the Saints increased thereby, slowly but surely, in population
and wealth. There were, however, at that time, thousands
of Saints in Europe anxious to emigrate, but who were too
poor to provide the small sum requisite for that purpose.
During the winter of 1855 this difficulty was discussed in
Conference by Brigham and the leading men in Salt Lake,
and some one suggested what was afterwards known as the
“Hand-Cart Scheme.” The idea of this “scheme” was to
transfer the people from Liverpool to the Frontiers in the
cheapest possible way, and for them then to cross the Plains
with light-made hand-carts, just strong enough to carry the
fewest possible necessary articles, but sufficiently light for the
men, women, and even young girls, to draw them.</p>

<p>This “plan” would not perhaps have been a bad one if it
had been properly carried out, and if Brigham Young had
seen, as he might have done, that suitable preparations were
made beforehand. But the Hand-Cart Emigration Scheme
began with a lie and ended in ruin.</p>

<p>The confiding Saints were told that “God” had specially
inspired His servant Brigham for this purpose, and the scheme
was a revelation direct from on high.—No proper measures
were taken to provide for the emigrants—all was done upon
faith—faith on the part of the people in their—as they
supposed—inspired leaders; deception on the part of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
leaders towards the people, whose only fault was that they
trusted them too well.</p>

<p>The <cite>Millennial Star</cite> proclaimed the “plan” to the Saints
in Europe, and so great was the response to this special summons
that in that year—1856—it was roughly estimated that
no fewer than five or six thousand Mormon emigrants travelled
from Liverpool to Salt Lake City. It was the first
company of these emigrants that Brother Benton alluded to
when he told Mr. Stenhouse that “<em>they</em>” were expected that
night or the next; but in those days emigrant vessels were
frequently delayed by adverse winds and other circumstances,
and no one could calculate upon the exact time of their arrival
in port.</p>

<p>The following morning, my husband, when he returned
from the <cite>Mormon</cite> office, brought with him a letter bearing the
English postmark, and addressed to me in the neat unmistakable
handwriting of Mary Burton. I had been waiting
and watching for a letter from her ever since our arrival; I
was anxious to hear from her, and I hastily tore it open, so
impatient was I to know how she was getting on. What I
read interested me deeply, though it did not surprise me. I
had seen Mary many times after the interview which I have
already related, and our conversations and discussions were to
us of all-absorbing interest; but as they were mostly personal
I have not cared to record them in this narrative. To tell
the truth, her love affairs with Elder Shrewsbury occupied
more and more the most prominent place in all our discussions.
His enthusiasm was perfectly infectious. As long as Mary
absolutely refused to see him, her love for him and her faith
in Mormonism were anything but overpowering. But Elder
Shrewsbury was one of those peculiar persons who have a sort
of magnetic charm about them; who, without our knowing it,
or even, in some instances, contrary to our will and reason,
enlist all our sympathies and leave behind them an impression
that we vainly try to efface. He only wanted <em>opportunity</em>,
and his success was sure.</p>

<p>Opportunity he had had for pressing his suit with Mary and
making an impression upon her heart, ever since the day when
they met at my door, and had taken that walk together,
as Mary said, for the purpose of discussing important matters.</p>

<p>Now the letter which I received opened to me another
chapter in Mary’s life, which without the gift of prophecy
I might have easily predicted. Elder Shrewsbury’s patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and perseverance met with their due reward, and Mary at
length promised to become his wife; but fascinated though
she was, and herself almost as deeply in love as he was, she
nevertheless made one condition which showed that she had
not entirely lost that prudence and determination which she
had shown in the early days of their courtship.</p>

<p>“When he spoke to me in <em>that</em> way—you know <em>how</em>, Sister
Stenhouse”—she said in her impulsive way, “How could
I persist in saying <em>No</em> to him? It wasn’t in my heart to do
so. I didn’t say ‘Yes’ in so many words, but I simply
said nothing, and he took my silence for consent. Then—but
no, I won’t even tell <em>you</em> everything....
I know he thought he was going to have it all his own way;
but I didn’t think so. I told him then that I had firmly resolved
upon one thing—that I never would marry him unless
he made a solemn vow and promise before God that he would
never enter into Polygamy. I could not hide from him that I
loved him—he knew it and could see it; but I said I <em>never</em> would
go to Utah alone, and I certainly never would marry at the
risk of my husband taking another wife. No; I was willing
to give him my heart, my all—it was only fair for him to do
the same by me.... He was very near me then,
and my hand was in his; and he was looking into my eyes.
Then he whispered the promise I had asked of him, and, dear
Sister Stenhouse, I <em>know</em> I can depend upon <em>his</em> word. We
shall be happier in this world <em>by ourselves</em>, and we feel quite sure
that God will not ask us to do anything in heaven that would
make us miserable. Perhaps I oughtn’t to say this, but I’m
so happy that I cannot allow myself one single wretched doubt
about the future or <em>my</em> husband, such as I used to have.... We
were married on the 27th of January....</p>

<p>“And now we are getting ready for Zion, and are busy
day and night. Of course you have heard of the “Divine
Plan”—the Hand-Cart Scheme. Oh, Sister Stenhouse, I
am so very, <em>very</em> much ashamed of myself for all the wicked
things that I used to say about the Apostles and the Elders.
Since our marriage, Elder Shrewsbury has explained everything
to me, and set things in their right light. It is a
glorious privilege for us to be permitted to gather to Zion,
and now that I know my dear husband will never even think
of another besides myself, I glory in the thought of leaving
the Gentile world and all its wickedness....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“We go with the first company this season.</p>

<p>“I will tell you all the rest of the news when I meet you,
dear.”</p>

<p>So Mary Burton was married, and coming with the Hand-Cart
Company. “Why,” I said, turning to my husband,
“they’ll be here in a day or two now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps to-day,” he replied.</p>

<p>They did not, however, arrive either that day or the next;
but towards the end of the week we were told that their
vessel was in the river, and I accompanied my husband to
Castle Gardens to see them.</p>

<p>A strange spectacle was presented to our view. More
than six hundred Mormon emigrants were gathered there, all
on their way to Zion, and burning with zeal and enthusiasm
worthy of a better cause. There were aged men and women,
whose heads were hoary with the snows of many a winter,
and whose tottering steps had borne them to the verge of
three score years and ten; there were stout-hearted fathers
and families, and matrons with sons and daughters growing
up around them; there were young men in the pride and
strength of manhood; and maidens in the modest blush of
womanly beauty; and little toddling children, and babes in
their mothers’ arms—all obedient to what they thought was
the command of God Himself—all with their faces set steadfastly
and anxiously Zionward.</p>

<p>Let not the reader smile at the blind infatuation of those
poor emigrants. Would he or she have suffered so confidingly—so
faithfully—for his or her religion? They might be
mistaken; but truly theirs was a faith which “hoped all
things, believed all things, endured all things.” Surely, in
His sight—who judges the heart—the blind obedience of those
men and women who were ready to suffer and to endure unto
the bitter end, because in their child-like faith they thought
that it was His holy will—such practical devotion was more
truly acceptable than the formal professions of an untested
faith.</p>

<p>I met at Castle Gardens many whom I had known in the
old country; but it was one particular face which I was
anxious to see. A man wrapped in a thick great coat, and
with a fur cap upon his head, brushed against me; and
before I had time to raise my eyes, my hand was grasped in
his, and I heard Mary’s husband say, “Oh Sister Stenhouse,
I’m so glad to see you; I knew we should meet you in New
York. Come and see Mary. She’s <em>my</em> Mary now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>I went with Elder Shrewsbury and I saw Mary. But oh,
how greatly was she changed! When I returned from our
Swiss mission and saw her after an interval of several years,
I was, of course, struck with the alteration which had then
transformed her from a pretty little fairy-like girl into a decorous
young lady contemplating matrimony; but although
I had now been absent from England only a few months, I
observed a much more striking alteration in her than on the
previous occasion. It was not now, I thought, so much an
outward and personal change, as a new development of her
inner consciousness—her soul itself. Her form was as graceful,
and her eyes as bright as ever; but from those eyes
there now shone forth another light than that which I had
thought so charming in the by-gone time.</p>

<p>Her affection for me was as warm and demonstrative as
when we first met. She recognized me in a moment, before
her husband had time to say a word; and, throwing both her
arms round me, she kissed me again and again with all the
effusion of her childish days. Taking my hand she led me
gently into a quiet corner and seated me beside her on a
big trunk, and then she began to talk. It was the same soft
sweet voice again, which used to be so dear to me when I was
left all alone in Southampton, soon after my marriage, while
my husband was on mission in Italy.</p>

<p>She told me all the story of her courtship—all, and much
more, than she had told me in her letter. But it was when she
came to speak of her marriage, of her husband, and especially
of their pilgrimage to Utah, that I observed more especially
the change which had taken place in her. She was no longer
the light-hearted girl, half-doubting her strange religion, and
rejecting it altogether when it did not coincide with her own
ideas and wishes. No: Elder Shrewsbury—had he been ten
times a Mormon Elder—could not have wished for a more
obedient, a more earnest, I might say, a more fanatical believer
than was now to be found in his young and beautiful
wife. Her eyes really glowed with enthusiasm as she spoke
of “the work of the Lord” and of “gathering to Zion;” and
her voice, though soft and sweet as ever, had in it, now and
then, a tinge of sternness which told of a determination and
spirit which the casual observer would never have suspected.</p>

<p>I expressed some surprise that she and her husband, not
being without funds, should have gone with the Hand-Cart
Company when they might have waited and have gone with so
much more comfort with one of the independent companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “we have done it as a
matter of faith. Certainly we could have afforded to go in
any way we chose, but my husband said we ought to be an
example to the poorer saints; so we gave away nearly all our
money to help the emigration fund, and then we came, just as
you see us, along with the rest.”</p>

<p>“But the danger and discomfort is so great,” I suggested.
“Surely the Lord does not want us to sacrifice ourselves when
no one is benefitted by it?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” said she; “there’s no danger, Sister Stenhouse,
and if there were it would only please me all the more. As
for discomfort, why we should have had that any way, and we
both glory in making sacrifices. Besides which, we have been
told by the Apostle that this will be the most pleasant and
successful journey across the Plains that has ever been
made.”</p>

<p>“I am a little doubtful of the promises of Apostles and
Elders,” I said; “and I remember, Mary, when you used to
agree with me.”</p>

<p>“I know I did,” she answered; “but Brother Shrewsbury
has shown me how wrong I was—I never doubt <em>now</em>. But I
think you have a wrong notion about this hand-cart scheme.
It is not an ordinary plan such as any man might have made.
God Himself revealed this plan to Brigham, and in fact we
call it ‘the divine plan’ in our songs. Oh, you should hear
our songs! They’re a little rough, but the singing is so
earnest and the voices of the men and girls blend so well
together, that I know you’d like them. There’s only one
thing that I don’t like about this plan, and that I daresay is
all right if only I knew it.”</p>

<p>“I think, Mary,” I said, “I could tell you a good deal that
you wouldn’t like if you knew it.”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” she replied hastily, as if afraid to hear me,
“don’t tell me unpleasant matters. I’ll tell you all I meant.
The Prophet and Heber C. Kimball, and Jedediah Grant,
counselled the richer emigrants to give as much as they could—all
their property, if they had faith enough—to help the
poor brethren to emigrate; but the American Elders had
private instructions—so Brother Shrewsbury told me—to use
the money to help out all the unmarried girls who are willing
to go. I confess that this troubled me not a little; but my
husband says that when we get to Zion we shall find all will
be right, and of course I believe him.”</p>

<p>Mary’s conversation puzzled me a good deal at the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
She had formerly been so clear-sighted and so unbiassed by
prejudice, and now she seemed ready to believe anything.
All her husband’s enthusiasm was now her own; she saw
with his eyes, and in the intensity of her love for him she
believed all that he accepted as true. Long after, when I
thought of that short interview, I called to mind her impulsive
earnestness, and I felt that a secret misgiving, unconsciously
to herself, was partly the cause of it. Unknown to herself
her excess of zeal was the offspring of doubt.</p>

<p>Life in the future was in anticipation to my poor friend one
long day of hope and happiness. She could not see the
shadow of a cloud—no coming sorrow darkened her way.
Zion, to her excited imagination, was the abode of peace, and
sanctity, and unchanging joy.</p>

<p>I asked her whether the Saints in England had heard any
of those strange reports about Brigham Young defying the
Government, which had attracted so much attention in this
country.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she said; “it is because the day is so very
near when all intercourse between God’s people and the
Gentile world shall be cut off for ever that these great efforts
are being made to gather the Saints to Zion. Of course you
know this, but I don’t think you know all. Why, at the last
general conference in Liverpool, the president had instructions
from Salt Lake to propose Brigham Young as ‘prophet,
seer, revelator, and <em>King</em>!’”</p>

<p>“<em>King?</em>” I said. “How can President Young ever be
‘king’? Utah is part of the territory of the States, and
under their jurisdiction; it is not even a State itself yet, and
Congress has refused to sanction the name of <i>Deseret</i>. This
country will never suffer a kingdom to be set up in Utah;
you must be misinformed, Sister Mary.”</p>

<p>“No, Sister Stenhouse,” she exclaimed, “I am under no
mistake. My husband assured me that the conference accepted
the proposition, and that it was received unanimously.
The Saints are gathering in from all parts of the world, and
when war is declared they will not be found unprepared.
Why, here on board with us, the American Elders are all
provided with swords and revolvers of the very best make
that could be got for love or money, and I myself have heard
them say that Brigham Young intends shortly to declare his
independence of the United States. We didn’t know this
before we left England, but we felt sure that he had some
great purpose in view which had been revealed to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Before we left,” I said, “the Saints were all eager to
emigrate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” she answered, “but nothing like they are now.
You have no idea how excited and anxious everybody is.
Some of the people, in order to obey counsel, sold their
watches and jewellery, and even their best clothes, scarcely
keeping enough for the journey, and every one who had any
money gave it away. Brigham Young set a noble example in
that; even the Gentiles would admire him if they knew all.
Why, we had on board ship with us Brother Tenant, the rich
new convert, who paid thirty thousand dollars for the property
which Brigham Young so generously gave to help the Emigration
Fund. He hardly had enough left to carry him and
his family to Zion; and now he is going to cross the Plains
with us, to settle in Salt Lake City. He is somewhere here
among the emigrants, I believe, at the present moment, and
you could ask him all about it if you liked. The brethren
assure him that Brother Brigham is so liberal that he will get
vastly more than the value of his thirty thousand dollars when
he reaches Zion, and I hope he will, for I like both him and
his wife.”</p>

<p>All this was thus far true, but it was with some misgivings
that I heard Mary talk about it. Still I tried to persuade
myself that it was a sin to doubt. How little did either of us
imagine that after poor Mr. Tenant’s miserable death upon
the Plains we should live to see his wife—destitute and
defrauded of her property by generous-hearted Brigham—dragging
out a miserable existence in Zion, and dependent
even for a crust of bread upon the kindness of the
brethren. And yet, as I have previously stated, this was
how the Prophet, under the mask of liberality, contrived, for
his own purposes, to cheat this unfortunate and too-confiding
Saint.</p>

<p>Then we talked of what more nearly interested ourselves,
and Mary asked me when Mr. Stenhouse and myself were
coming out. I told her that it was quite uncertain, but that
we expected to before long. “At any rate you will come out
before the season is over?” she said.</p>

<p>“Most likely so,” I replied; “but you will be safely there
and settled before we arrive.”</p>

<p>How little did she imagine the fearful scenes she was to
witness—the terrible sufferings she was to endure—before the
season she spoke of had passed away. Could I at that time
have known all, I would have prayed that sooner than set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
on that fearful journey she might find refuge in the grave
from the horrors which, unknown to her, were brooding over
her way.</p>

<p>We talked long, and then my husband joined us—Elder
Shrewsbury was called away by some necessary duty—and
when we parted it was with many promises to write frequently
to each other of our common religious interests, as well as the
welfare of ourselves and those we loved. Then I spoke with
several other old friends, and we exchanged greetings with all
sorts of people, for my husband wherever he goes is always
sure to be upon speaking terms with almost everybody he
meets.</p>

<p>The Hand-Cart Company left New York for Utah—a long
and formidable journey at best—but in that instance, through
mismanagement and neglect, one of the most fatal expeditions
that imprudent man has ever undertaken; and it was not
until months and months had passed away, and another
season had come round, that we heard anything of their fate.</p>

<p>And time went on, but my troubles did not lighten. My
husband still continued to work at the <cite>Mormon</cite> office, and
after a while his salary was slightly increased from time to
time; but still his earnings were altogether inadequate for the
support of a family, and I found it absolutely necessary to
obtain some employment for myself. It cost me many a long
and weary day of search and inquiry, and many a battle with
my pride, before I could get anything to do; but at last I was
successful, and although my little ones required constant
attention, I contrived to add a very decent quota to the
scanty family purse.</p>

<p>And thus matters continued until the following year—our
life of uncertainty and care unchanged. Little in my life at
that time is worth recording: to me it was one long, painful
struggle, and any change which could come I felt must be
for the better. My experience of Mormonism was of course
enlarged as new facts presented themselves to my observation,
and by nothing was my faith so much shaken as by the discrepancies
between the written and spoken Mormonism which
was presented with fair face to the European Saints and the
world at large, and the actual conduct of the Elders.</p>

<p>From the first moment when Polygamy was announced,
the leaders had strictly forbidden the missionaries to enter
into any alliances with the sisters abroad, or to make any
proposals of marriage to them, or to enter into any matrimonial
covenants. In the language of Heber C. Kimball—Brigham’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
first counsellor—they were “not to pick out from
the flock the young, fair, and tender lambs,” but were to
bring them all safely home to Zion.</p>

<p>This counsel was all very well, for it tended to keep the
Elders out of mischief, and afforded an opportunity to the
brethren at home to select more and more youthful wives
from the fair converts who were gathered in to Zion. But
the missionaries found it very irksome to obey this counsel, and
in point of fact those who did so formed a very small minority.</p>

<p>One of the missionaries who had just returned from Europe
came one day to our house in New York, and brought a
youthful sister with him. He was by no means a handsome
man or prepossessing in his appearance, but I saw at once
that he had succeeded in obtaining considerable influence
over the young sister’s mind. He said she was not very
happy, and he wanted her to stay with some respectable
family for a week or two until they set out for Utah, and I
agreed that she should stay with us.</p>

<p>She began to play with the children, and took one of them
in her arms in a way which attracted my attention, for I
noticed that tears were in her eyes, and she excited my sympathy.
I asked her as gently and as delicately as I could
what was the matter with her, and what her sorrow was, and
she told me that she herself had two little ones at home and
was wretched at being parted from them. She had obeyed
counsel, and had left her husband and a happy home to go to
Zion. She loved them all dearly; but, deluded by false teachings,
and promises that she should soon have her children
again, she had stolen away and left them all.</p>

<p>I reasoned with her, tried to make her see how wrongly
she had acted, and persuaded her to return to her husband
and seek his forgiveness. But it was all in vain. The salvation
of her soul she thought was beyond all earthly considerations;
she must stifle the suggestions of her heart
within her; she must hasten to Zion. Thus she left me, and
like many another victim, I never expected to see her again.</p>

<p>One morning, a few months later, I was astonished to
receive a visit from her. After expressing my pleasure at
seeing her once more, she told me that what I said had so
impressed her that when the emigrants had arrived at St.
Louis she had refused to proceed any further on the journey,
had written to her husband, had made everything right with
him, and was now on her way back to her home in England.</p>

<p>My story is so full of painful reminiscences, that it is with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
pleasure that I record this incident—one of the rare cases
in which folly was not succeeded by utter ruin and misery.
Alas, how many instances I might mention, which fell
beneath my own personal observation, of wives and mothers
led away by the delusive doctrines which they mistook for
inspiration, and who sought vainly, through years of misery,
for peace and rest, until at length they found it in the darkness
of the tomb.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1857, the difficulties in Utah,
and a financial panic in New York, resulted in the discontinuance
of the <cite>Mormon</cite>. My husband was thus thrown out of
employment, and to add to our difficulties the people for whom
I worked suspended operations. This new trial of our faith,
however, was not long; out of apparent evil good came.
Released from his obligations to the Apostle and the Mormon
paper, my husband now set earnestly to work to obtain a
living without the crippling influences of “counsel” or the
dictates of those whom his religion taught him to respect.</p>

<p>I had always believed that if suffered to act for himself, his
energy was such that he would certainly carve his way to a
respectable position in the world. In this I was not deceived,
either at the time of which I speak or at a later period when,
in Salt Lake City, he engaged in active business on his own
account. In New York, where he had been, by this time,
appointed President of the Eastern Mission, and was actively
engaged in advocating the claims of the Mormon Church, he
sought and found employment on the staff of the <cite>Herald</cite>, and
in connexion with other daily papers; and such was his success,
that from a condition of misery and poverty we were very
soon raised to a position of comfort, and surrounded by every
luxury suitable to our station in life; and this position we
enjoyed until called upon to leave all and journey across the
Plains to Zion.</p>

<p>Our own journey to Zion was postponed for a while; but
not long before we set forth, I received the long-expected
letter which Mary Burton had promised me; and as it contains
a vivid picture of a mode of transit—the only mode
which could <em>then</em> be used—across the Plains, and shows what
people were forced to endure so recently as a few short years
ago, I shall give it in the following chapter; for I feel sure
that if the reader did not peruse the story in the exact words of
my unfortunate friend, he never would believe that in this
country and in our own times such a terrible tragedy could
have been enacted.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">A TERRIBLE STORY:—THE HAND-CART EMIGRANTS CROSSING
THE PLAINS.</span></h2>

<p>“I promised to write and tell you all about our journey
across the Plains, but I little expected to have such a terrible
tale to tell.</p>

<p>“You have heard so much of the journey to Salt Lake
Valley that you know pretty well how we must have travelled
to Iowa City, where it was necessary that we should wait until
the whole company was quite ready for the long journey which
lay before us.</p>

<p>“Our life up to a certain point was much the same, and we
met with the same difficulties as all other emigrants who had
gone before us. But there the comparison ends. Privation,
and toil, and weariness, and not infrequently sickness and
death, wore out many of the companies that went before us,
but they never suffered as we did. It is utterly impossible
for me to tell you all that we went through. And when I
finish this letter and lay down my pen, and even when you
read the fearful story of my own experience during that journey,
you will still have but the faintest idea of the horrors and
sufferings which we endured.</p>

<p>“At Iowa City we found nothing prepared for us. When
we left Liverpool we were told that hand-carts, provisions, and
all that we needed, should be provided before we arrived. If
this had been done we should have had just fairly time
enough to travel over the Plains and reach Salt Lake before
the terrible cold of winter set in. As it was, everything went
wrong. The Elders who had been sent out before us to buy
tents and carts and all that we wanted had either been
unfortunate or very careless, for, as I said, when we arrived
in Iowa City not the slightest preparation had been made.</p>

<p>“You know how strong my faith was when we left New
York, and how Brother Shrewsbury and myself were ready to
sacrifice everything. I can assure you that we were fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
tested, and I do think that but for our strong faith not a
single soul of all that company would have survived that
journey.</p>

<p>“Three companies had, after a long delay, been sent out
before we reached Iowa City. As it was then early in the
season, they completed their journey before the cold of winter
set in. I afterwards heard that Brigham Young and the
Elders, when they saw those companies arrive safely in Salt
Lake City, spoke of the scheme as <em>a successful experiment</em>.
We had been taught that the scheme came directly from
heaven, and was neither speculation nor experiment, and when
I heard that, after all, the Prophet himself spoke of it as a
matter of doubtful issue, I asked myself—<em>Whom</em>, then, can we
believe?</p>

<p>“We waited three weeks in Iowa Camp while they were
making the hand-carts. They were very lightly made, and
I think not at all suitable for such a long and wearisome journey;
and being so hastily put together, and most of the wood
unseasoned, they were utterly unfit for the rough work for
which they were constructed. Twenty of these carts—one to
every five—were allowed to every hundred persons, who were
also allowed five good-sized tents and one Chicago waggon,
with three yoke of oxen, to transport the baggage and provisions.
We were only allowed seventeen pounds of bedding
and clothing each, which, with cooking utensils, &amp;c., made up
about one hundred pounds to each cart, and that was quite as
much as the cart (itself only sixty pounds in weight) could
carry. You can see, Sister Stenhouse, how difficult it must
have been out of every hundred persons—men, women, and
children—to find twenty who were strong enough to pull even
such frail things as those hand-carts were. The married men
and the young men and boys did the best they could, but they
could do no more, and some of the carts were drawn by young
girls alone.</p>

<p>“The girls and women who had no husbands used to occupy
a tent by themselves at night; but in the other tents,
whole families, without respect to age or sex, together with
the young men who assisted them during the day, used to
find shelter. This you will see at once was exceedingly inconvenient;
but we had no choice, and we had been so long
associated, and had suffered so much together, that we did not
feel it as much as we otherwise must have done.</p>

<p>“What weary days we spent! Hour after hour went by,
mile after mile we walked, and never, never seemed to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
step the further on our way. Sometimes I recalled to mind a
hymn which we used to sing at Sunday School, when I was a
child—an evening hymn in which we returned thanks that we
were—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘A day’s march nearer home.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“But day after day went by—wearily, hopelessly—and
when each night came on, and, tired and footsore, we lay down
to rest, we seemed no nearer to our home in Zion.</p>

<p>“Do not think, Sister Stenhouse, that we gave way to
despondency. What we felt, God alone knows; but our poor
weary hearts were full of confiding faith in Him, and we
placed undoubting confidence in the promises and prophecies
which we had received through His chosen servants. The
young folks were light-hearted and gay, and with all the
enthusiasm of youth they pressed on, thinking not of the way
but only of the end; and their example was most encouraging.</p>

<p>“My husband was one of the bravest and truest of all that
band. He drew the cart which we shared with another Elder
and his wife and their grown-up daughter. They were old
people—I mean the Elder and his wife—and the daughter was
an old maid, unpleasant, thin, and sour, and too feeble to do
anything. There were reasons why I was excused from taking
any share in hard work; but I felt as zealous as the rest,
and day after day walked beside my husband, thinking that,
if nothing more, my companionship might cheer him. The
old folks walked behind, and so did the children; but sometimes,
when the little ones were very weary indeed, the parents
would place them on the top of the bedding in the hand-cart,
and give them a lift. But some of the elderly people who
were unused to walking far, and whom it was impossible to
carry, suffered a great deal; and sometimes mothers with
children at their breasts would trudge on mile after mile in all
the heat and dust without a murmur or complaint, until they
almost dropped down with fatigue. What some of those poor
creatures suffered, no words could tell.</p>

<p>“The sun shone down upon us with intense heat as we
travelled through Iowa, and the people from the farm-houses
and villages came out to see us, and wondered at our rashness
in undertaking such a journey. They were very kind to us,
and came and visited us in our camps, and offered some of the
men work and good wages if they would stay there instead of
going on to Zion. A few of the people accepted these offers;
but the Elders, as you may suppose, watched carefully every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
company and every man; and in the evening, when meetings
for prayer and preaching were held, we were earnestly exhorted
to obedience, and the sin of acting upon our own judgments
was set forth in the very plainest terms. The kindness of the
Iowa people, however, encouraged us, and they freely gave
to those who most needed whatever they could to help us on
our way.</p>

<p>“And we needed help and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Of course, with only one waggon to carry all the provisions
for a hundred persons, besides five tents, our supply of food
was very limited. At that period of the journey the grown-up
people were allowed ten ounces of flour a day and a little—and
but a very little—coffee, sugar, rice, and bacon. This
was a very scanty allowance for people who all day long had
to draw the hand-carts or to trudge mile after mile in all that
burning heat and dust—but we never complained. Some of
the men ate all their rations at breakfast, and went without
anything more until the next morning, unless they were able
to beg a little of some friendly farmer by the way. The little
children received just half as much as the others. With a
very small amount of management this inconvenience might
certainly have been avoided, for provisions of all sorts were
very cheap in the districts through which we passed. Some
of the more thoughtful saints, I know, felt very bitterly the
injustice of this; for, as you are aware, we had paid <em>all</em> our expenses
<em>in full</em>—even to the uttermost farthing; and we had
been promised in return a safe and sufficient outfit with plenty
of provisions, and in fact all that was necessary. Had we been
left to ourselves, we should of course have provided for every
contingency; but we came in obedience to counsel under the
direction of the Church, and after we had paid for everything;
the Church even ‘took care’ of our money, so that we therefore
could not procure necessaries by the way, as otherwise
we might have done.</p>

<p>“Thus wearily, and suffering not a little privation, we
travelled all through Iowa, until we came to the Missouri
river and encamped at Florence, a place about six miles north
of Omaha, and there we remained about a week, preparing for
our journey across the Plains.</p>

<p>“It was the middle of August when we arrived at Florence,
and we had been delayed so much on the way that it appeared
to many of the more experienced that it would now be the
height of imprudence for us to cross the Plains at that season.
With old people, delicate women, and little children, and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
carriages of any sort—except the frail hand-carts that
carried our bedding—it would be a weary, long time, before we
could reach Salt Lake. Every step must be trudged on foot,
and it was quite impossible that we could walk many miles a
day, while there was before us a journey of over a thousand.
Some of the Elders proposed that we should settle where
we were, or somewhere near by, until the following spring,
and then go on to Zion; but others who were more confident
urged that we should proceed at once. The Elders called a
great meeting to settle the matter, at which we were all
present.</p>

<p>“I should tell you that when we first started our whole
company was placed under the guidance of Elder James G.
Willie as captain; and we were again subdivided into five
parties of about one hundred each, and over every hundred
was placed an Elder or sub-captain. The first hundred was
headed by Elder Atwood, the second by Levi Savage, the
third by William Woodward, the fourth by John Chislett, and
the fifth by Elder Ahmensen. About two hundred of the
people were Scotch and Scandinavians; nearly all the rest
were English. All were assembled at the meeting. You
know, Sister Stenhouse, how meetings were held at home.
Well, it was just the same there. We, of course, had nothing
really to say—we had only to obey counsel and sanction the
decision of the leading Elders. I used to feel annoyed rather
at that sort of thing in London, as you may remember; but
now, when life and death depended upon the wisdom of our
decision, with all my faith, I felt worse than annoyed, wicked
as I have no doubt it was for me to feel so. My husband
never uttered a word, but I know he felt much as I did, and
in that he was not alone among the Elders.</p>

<p>“We had neither vote nor influence—the Elders held our
destiny in their hands. In all our company there were only
three or four men who had been out to Salt Lake before, and
of course they could not be overlooked, so they gave their
opinion at the meeting. They must have fully known the
dangers and difficulties of the way, and what hardships <em>must</em>
overtake a company so scantily provided for as was ours, if
we continued our journey. But, for all that, they not only
spoke slightingly of the danger which threatened us, but
prophesied, in the name of the Lord, that we should pass
through triumphantly and suffer neither loss nor harm.</p>

<p>“One man alone—Levi Savage—dared to tell the truth.
People well-mounted, or even with good ox-teams, could safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and easily make the journey, he said; but for a band of people
like ourselves, with aged folks, and women, and little children,
to attempt it so late was little short of madness. He strongly
urged that we should take up our quarters there for the
Winter, when, he said, as soon as spring came on, we could
safely and successfully perform the remainder of our journey.</p>

<p>“The other Elders thought that he was weak in the faith,
and plainly told him so; and one of them even said, ‘he’d eat
all the snow that fell between Florence and Salt Lake City.’
The people, of course, believed without question what they
were told to believe, for they had long ago made up their
minds that the leaders were inspired, and therefore they dared
not doubt them, and the prudent counsel of Brother Savage
was rejected accordingly. I was not near enough to hear his
words, but I was afterwards told that he said, ‘What I have
said, I know is the truth; but as you are counselled to go forward,
I will go with you; I will work, and rest, and suffer
with you; and, if God wills it so, I will also die with you.’
Never was man more faithful to his word than was Brother
Savage, and often after that, when sickness, and weariness,
and cold, and hunger, and death, overtook us—as he had foreseen—he
never for one moment forgot the promise which he
had so solemnly made.</p>

<p>“Then—the middle of August being passed—we left Florence
behind us, and began our weary journey across the
Plains in much the same fashion as we had already travelled
through Iowa. We had, however, taken fresh provisions to
last us until we reached Utah, and as the oxen could not
draw so much extra weight, one sack, weighing about a hundred
pounds, was placed on each of the hand-carts, in
addition to the other baggage. This was a severe tax upon
the endurance of the people, but most of them bore it without
a murmur. On the other hand, we fared a little better in
the matter of provisions, for we were allowed a pound of flour
a day each, and also, occasionally, a little fresh beef, and
besides that each hundred had three or four milch cows. As
we continued our journey, and the provisions were consumed,
the burdens on the carts, of course, grew lighter.</p>

<p>“But this was only the beginning of our pilgrimage;—the
end we could not foresee. Every evening, when we pitched
our tents, we endeavoured—by songs, and jests, and interesting
stories—to beguile the tediousness of the way. The days were
not quite so warm now, and the nights were more chilly;
but altogether, it was much more pleasant travelling than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
it was in the earlier part of the journey, and no one seemed
to remember the almost prophetic remonstrance of Brother
Savage.</p>

<p>“Still we travelled very slowly, for the carts were always
breaking down; the wheels came off, and we had nothing to
grease them with. The boxes of the wheels were made of
unseasoned wood, and the heavy pressure upon them, and the
dust that got into them, soon wore them out. Some of the
people cut off the tops of their boots and wrapped them
round the axles, and others cut up their tin plates and kettles
for the same purpose; and for grease they used soap, and even
their pitiful allowance of bacon. But as the days passed, and
the flour began to be used up, these accidents became less
frequent.</p>

<p>“Upon an average, they said, we travelled about fifteen
miles a day, which I think was very good. Some few days
we even made a little over twenty miles, but they were
balanced by the shortcomings. We tried to feel happy and
hopeful, and even the aged and infirm tried to make light of
their toil and privations, for we did not see that heavy cloud
which was looming across our way. I frequently talked with
the old and weakly among the people, to whom both my husband
and myself were able to offer little kindnesses, and they
all spoke cheerfully of our prospects. Such faith had they in
the promises of the Elders.</p>

<p>“Just before we reached Wood river, vast herds of buffaloes
appeared in our vicinity, and one evening all our cattle
stampeded, and the men had to go in search of them. About
thirty were lost, and after hunting after them for three days,
we gave them up. We had only one yoke of oxen now for
each waggon, and as the waggons were loaded each with three
thousand pounds of flower, the teams could not move them.
So they yoked up the beef-cattle, and cows, and heifers, but
they were unmanageable; and at last we were obliged again
to place a sack of flower upon each hand-cart.</p>

<p>“This sorely tried us all. Some of the people even complained,
but the greater part of us bore up bravely, believing
that it was the will of the Lord. We still had faith that all
would yet be well. This was, however, a hard blow. Our
milch cows were useless to us, our beef-rations were stopped,
and the burdens which we drew were doubled. Every one did
his or her best, but many of us began to be disheartened, and
could hardly get along.</p>

<p>“One evening there was quite a commotion in the camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
We had pitched our tents for the night on the banks of the
Platte river, I think, when suddenly quite a grand turn-out of
carriages and light waggons came up from the east and joined
us. Each carriage was drawn by four horses, and the outfits
were in first-class style. Nothing could be too good for
Apostles and other ‘distinguished’ servants of the Lord, I
was anxious to know who they were, but was not long in
finding out. There was the Apostle Franklin Richards, and
Elders Webb and Felt, and Joseph A. Young, the son of the
Prophet, and Elders Dunbar, and Kimball, and Grant—all
returning Missionaries. They stayed with us all night, and
in the morning called a great meeting, and the Apostle Richards
delivered a speech, which since has troubled me not a little,
and made me very sorrowful.</p>

<p>“He had heard of what Brother Savage had said, and then
and there, before us all, he rebuked him. He then exhorted
us to remember the hope set before us, and told us to pray
and work on, and especially to be obedient to counsel; and
he finished by solemnly prophesying, in the name of the God
of Israel, that the Almighty would make a way for us to Zion;
and that though the snow might fall and the storm rage on
the right hand and on the left, not a hair of our heads should
be hurt.</p>

<p>“Some of the people wept with joy as they heard these
words. My own heart was full. To me, this was the voice
of inspiration—the voice of God—how could I doubt again?</p>

<p>“Sister Stenhouse, before a month was over, I saw with
my own eyes that prophecy, those promises, falsified to the
very letter; and yet at the time they came to me and to all
else as the word of the Lord from heaven. Tell me, if men
can thus deceive themselves—for I do not doubt for a moment
that the Apostle believed his own prophecy—and if we could
be so sadly deluded as to believe that what was said was
divine—what surety have we for our religion at all? I strive
against these sinful doubts, but they <em>will</em> sometimes creep into
my heart unbidden.</p>

<p>“The Apostle and the Elders with him told Captain Willie
that they wanted some fresh meat, and the Elders killed and
gave them of our very best. What could be denied to the
Servants of the Lord? We were then more than four
hundred in number—aged men and feeble women, with babes
and poor little children too young to walk; many of them
infirm and sick, all of them footsore and weary. We were far
away from home, travelling slowly hundreds and hundreds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
miles, worn out, and without sufficient provisions for the way,
or the remotest chance of obtaining any. And yet, oh God!
I shame to tell it; these servants of Heaven—our leaders, our
guides, our example—these chosen vessels who came to us,
riding comfortably and at ease in their well-appointed carriages,
took of our poverty—took the very best we had!</p>

<p>“As they left the camp, I looked up into my husband’s face,
and our eyes met. We said not a word, but in our hearts there
was the same thought. Sister Stenhouse, there must have
been that self-same thought in the mind of many another poor
soul who watched those Elders depart after they had lectured
us on faith and patience and obedience!</p>

<p>“They crossed the river pleasantly enough, and pointed
out the best fording-place, and then they watched us wade
through—the water there being nearly a mile in width, and
in some places two and even three feet in depth—and though
many of the heavy-laden carts were drawn by women and girls
they never so much as offered to lend us the aid of their handsome
teams. One sister told me that they watched the poor
people crossing, through glasses, as if it were an entertainment;
but I did not see that, and can hardly believe it was true. All
that they did, however, was to promise that when we reached
Laramie we should find provisions and bedding and other
necessaries ready for us, and that they would send help from
Salt Lake Valley to meet us.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">MARY BURTON’S STORY CONTINUED:—TERRIBLE ENDING OF
THE HAND-CART SCHEME.</span></h2>

<p>“It was early in September when we reached Laramie, but
we found nothing awaiting us there. We were all very much
discouraged at this, and Captain Willie called another meeting
for consultation. We knew of course, beforehand, that our
position was very bad; but figures, when stated plainly, become
startling facts. We now learned that if we continued at the
same rate as that at which we had previously been travelling,
and received each the same allowance daily, we should be left
utterly destitute of provisions when we were yet three hundred
and fifty miles from the end of our journey. Nothing remained
but to reduce our allowance; so, instead of one pound, we
were rationed at three-quarters of a pound a day, and at
the same time were forced to make incredible exertions to
travel faster.</p>

<p>“Not long after this, Captain Willie received a message
from the Apostle Richards. It is the custom, you know, for
people who want to send messages to emigrants who come after
them to write a note on a scrap of paper, and tie it to a stone
or a piece of wood, and leave it on the way. No one disturbs
it, as no one but the emigrants travel along that road, and
they are sure to find it. It was from a rough post-office like
this that Captain Willie got his letter. In it the Apostle told
him that we should receive supplies from Salt Lake when we
reached the South Pass; but that we knew would be too late.
So our allowance was again reduced, and after that we were
rationed at an average of ten ounces for every person over ten
years of age. The men who drew the carts received twelve
ounces, the women and aged men nine ounces, and the children
from four to eight ounces according to age. Before this,
the men with families had done better than the single men, as
they had been able to save a little from the children’s rations,
and of course they did not like this new arrangement so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Picture to yourself these men—in the cool air of September,
drawing after them each one a loaded cart, with one or
more children most frequently superadded to its weight, trudging
wearily every day, ten, fifteen, or twenty miles over the
rough desert, wading across streams with the women and children,
setting up tents at night, working as they never worked
before in all their lives, and withal keeping soul and body
together upon twelve ounces of flour a day. This is but one
side of the picture—the physical toil and endurance of the
working men. Think what the feeble and aged, the sick, the
women and children, must have endured!</p>

<p>“By this time many of those who had hitherto held out
bravely began to fail, and the people in general were greatly
discouraged. Captain Willie and the Elders who assisted
him did their best to keep up the spirits of the people, and
to get them over as much ground as they could each day. The
captains over the hundreds had also no little work to perform
in distributing provisions, helping the sick and infirm, and,
in fact, superintending everything.</p>

<p>“For some time the nights had been getting colder and
colder, and by the time we arrived at the Sweetwater river
we suffered considerably from that cause; we felt that winter
was fast approaching. In fact, it came on earlier and more
severely last year than at any time before since the Saints
settled in Utah. Does it not seem strange that at the very
time when they were offering up special prayers for us in
Zion, that we might be defended from cold and storm, the
terrors of a more than ordinary winter overtook us and proved
fatal to so many of our company? The mountains were
covered with snow; and it was soon quite evident, even to
those who had prophesied most loudly that the Lord would
work a special miracle in our behalf, that the storm-clouds of
winter would soon burst upon us.</p>

<p>“You have never seen the Sweetwater river, so I may as
well tell you that it is a very irregular stream, and we had to
cross it again and again upon our way. As usual we had to
wade through the water each time, and though the men
helped over the women and children as well as they could,
many of us got very wet indeed, and quite chilled, and we
were all cold and miserable. Still, our faith never gave way—some,
I know, began to doubt a little, but they had not yet
lost all faith, and discouraged and wretched, as indeed we
were, the greater number bore up with heroic resolution. I
noticed, however, on the faces of some poor souls—men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
women—a peculiar expression which it is quite impossible for
me to describe. Later on I was led to believe that at that
time they, perhaps unconsciously, felt the presentiment of that
fearful death which so soon overtook them.</p>

<p>“We suffered much at night. You may remember that I
told you we were only allowed seventeen pounds of clothing
and bedding, and that, of course, was of little use. Sleeping
in a tent, under any circumstances, is not generally pleasant
to those who are accustomed to the shelter of a house; but
sleeping in a tent, exposed to the keen night air of a wilderness,
and with scarcely a rag of covering, was almost sufficient
to prove fatal to the stoutest and strongest. During
the summer time, although our fare was scanty and our labour
incessant, we rose each morning refreshed and strengthened,
and ready for the toils of the day. But now we crept out of
our tents cramped and miserable, half-frozen, and with our
eyes red and tearful with the cold. We seemed to have no
life left in us.</p>

<p>“These things soon began to tell upon the health of every
one of us, especially upon the aged and those who were sickly.
Hope at last died out in their poor weary hearts. One by
one they fell off—utterly worn out. Poor things! how they
had longed to see the promised Zion, and now all expectation
of peaceful rest on earth was over—the bitter end had come.</p>

<p>“We dug graves for them by the wayside in the desert, and
there we laid them with many tears, scarcely daring to look
one another in the face, for we felt that our own time might
perhaps be nearer than we thought.</p>

<p>“One by one at first they fell off, but before long the
deaths became so frequent that it was seldom that we left a
camp-ground without burying one or more. This was, however,
only the beginning of evil.</p>

<p>“Soon it was no longer the aged and sickly who were
taken off, but the young and strong, who under other circumstances
would have set disease and death at defiance. Cold,
hunger, and excessive toil brought on dysentery; and when
once attacked by that there was little hope for the sufferer,
for we had no medicine, and it was quite out of our power to
give them relief in any other way. I now began to fear for
my husband, for I had noticed for some time an expression of
extreme weariness in his face. Our trials had not hardened
our hearts; on the contrary, I think, as death seemed to be
drawing near, our affection for each other grew more pure and
devoted, and in my heart I often prayed, that if it were His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
will, God would let us die together and rest in the same
grave. We never spoke a word to each other on this subject,
but we felt the more. I exerted all my strength, and day
after day toiled along at his side, helping him all I could;
but although he never complained, I saw in his eyes a dull
and heavy look which, more than any words, told of failing
strength and the approach of disease, and my heart sank within
me.</p>

<p>“But my own troubles did not alone engross my attention;
there was too much wretchedness around us to allow any one
to be absorbed entirely in his own griefs. Acts of devotion
on the part of both parents and children came before me daily
such as would have put to shame the stories of filial and
parental piety which we used to be taught at school.</p>

<p>“I saw one poor man, whose health had evidently never
been strong, draw the cart with his two little ones in it, as
well as the baggage, mile after mile, until he could hardly
drag his weary limbs a step further; his wife carried a little
five-months old baby in her bosom. This they did day after
day, until disease attacked the husband, and it was evident
that he could bear up no longer. The next morning I saw
him, pale as a corpse, bowed down, and shivering in every
limb, but still stumbling on as best he could. Before the day
was half over, the poor wife lagged behind with her babe, and
the husband did not seem to notice her. This was not the
result of heartlessness on his part; I believe that even then
he had lost all consciousness. He did not know it, but he
was dying. Still he stumbled on, until the short wintry day
came to a close, and we pitched our camp, and then I missed
him. There was no time to inquire, and a chill came over
my heart as I thought of what might be his fate. Presently
my husband came to the tent and told me all. The poor man
had dragged the cart up to the last moment, and, when the
company halted for the night, he had turned aside, and sitting
down he bowed his head between his knees and never spoke
again. Later still, the poor wife reached the camp, and I saw
her then. There was no tear in her eyes, and she uttered
neither cry nor moan, but there was upon her features a
terrible expression of fixed despair which I dared not even
look upon.</p>

<p>“A few days after this, one morning as we were almost
ready to start, I saw that poor mother in her tent, just as they
had found her. She was cold and still—frozen to death—her
sorrows were over at last, and her poor weary spirit was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at rest; but on her bosom, still clasped in her arms, and
still living, was her little child, unconscious of its mother’s
fate.</p>

<p>“Most of those who died, as far as I could tell, seemed to
pass away quietly and with little pain, as if every feeling of
the heart were numbed and dead. But my own sufferings
and fears at that time were so great that I could not be a
very close observer. Strange as it may seem, the fear of
death did not so much appear to terrify these poor victims
as the thought that their bodies would be buried by the wayside
in the desert, instead of in the sacred ground of Zion.
Poor souls! the absorbing passion of their life was strong in
death.</p>

<p>“As death thinned our ranks, the labours of those who
survived were increased, until at last there were hardly
enough left with strength sufficient to pitch our tents at
night. A great deal devolved upon the captain of our
hundred, Elder Chislett. He is a very good man, and a
devoted Saint; and I am glad to say that both he and a lady
to whom he was betrothed, and who was also with our company,
escaped with their lives. I have often seen him, when
we stopped for the night, carrying the sick and feeble on his
back from the waggon to the fire, and then working harder
than a slave would work in putting things straight for the
night. He showed a great many kindnesses to my husband
and myself.</p>

<p>“But individual efforts availed nothing against fatigue and
hunger, and the fearful cold. To the minds of all of us, the
end was fast approaching. Nothing but our faith sustained
us; and foolish as many people would think that faith, I am
quite sure, that but for it, no living soul of all our company
would have ever reached Salt Lake.</p>

<p>“At last the storm came, and the snow fell—I think it
must have been at least five or six inches deep within half an
hour. The wind was very keen and cutting, and it drifted
the snow right into our faces; and thus blinded by the storm,
and scarcely able to stand, we stumbled on that day for fully
sixteen miles. What we suffered it would be useless for me
to attempt to describe. Some of the scenes we witnessed were
heart-rending.</p>

</div>

<p>“There was a young girl, with whom I was very well
acquainted, and whom I saw struggling in the snow, clinging to
one of the hand-carts, and vainly trying to help in pushing it
on, but really doing just the contrary. She is now in Salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Lake City, a helpless cripple, her limbs downwards having
been frozen during that storm, and subsequently amputated.
A poor old woman, too, whom I think you must have known in
London, lingered behind later in the day. When night came
on it was impossible for any one to go back to search for her,
but, in the morning, not very far from the camp, some torn
rags—the remains of her dress—were found, a few bones, a
quantity of hair, and at a little distance a female skull, well
gnawed, and with the marks of the wolf-fangs still wet upon
it;—the snow all round was crimsoned with blood.</p>

<p>“We halted for a little while in the middle of that day, and
to our surprise and joy, Joseph A. Young and Elder Stephen
Taylor drove into the camp. We found that when the
returning missionaries, of whom I have already told you, left
us by the Platte river, they made their way as speedily as
they could to Salt Lake City. Joseph A., who felt deeply for
our sufferings, although he had been away from home for two
whole years, hastened to his father, and reported to him the
condition in which we were. Brigham Young was of course
anxious to undo the mischief which had resulted from the
people following his inspired counsel, and at his son’s earnest
entreaty allowed him to return with provisions and clothing
to meet us. Joseph A. lost no time, but pressed on to the
rescue, and having told us that assistance was on the way,
hastened eastward to meet the company that was following
us.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you what a relief this intelligence was to the
minds of all, and how much the poor people felt encouraged
by it. But as for me, at that time my heart was sad enough.
For some time my husband’s strength had evidently been
failing, and for the last two days I had felt very serious
apprehensions on his behalf. He had been overtasked, and
like the rest of us he was starving with cold and hunger, and
I saw that he could not hold out much longer. My worst
fears were speedily realized. We had not journeyed half a
mile from the place where we rested at noon, when, blinded
by the snow, and completely broken down, he dropped the
rail of the cart, and I saw that he could go no further. How
I felt, you, as a wife and mother, only can guess. In a
moment my own weakness was forgotten; my love for my
husband made me strong again. To leave him there or to
delay would have been death to one if not all of us. So I
called to those who shared the cart with us, and they helped
me as well as they could to lift my husband up, and put him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
under part of the bedding. It was the only chance of saving
his life; for, as I before mentioned, some, previous to this, who
had been overcome, and had lingered by the way, had been
frozen to death or devoured by the wolves.</p>

<p>“I then took hold of the cross-bar or handle of the cart,
and numbed with the cold, and trembling in every limb, it
was as much as I could do to raise it from the ground. To move
the cart was impossible, so I appealed to the old folks again,
and they exerted all their strength to push it from behind, and
our combined efforts at length succeeded; but the chief weight
fell upon me. How gladly I bore it; how gladly I would
have borne anything for the mere chance of saving my dear
husband’s life, your own heart can tell.</p>

<p>“The snow drifted wildly around us, and beat in our faces
so blindingly that we could hardly proceed. The greater part
of the train had passed on while we delayed on account of my
husband, and now every one was making the most desperate
efforts to keep up with the rest; to be left behind was death.
Had I been asked whether under any circumstances I could
have dragged that heavy cart along in all that storm, I should
certainly have replied that it would be utterly impossible; but
until we are tried we do not know what we can bear. It was
not until the night came on, and we pitched our tents, that I
realized what I had passed through.</p>

<p>“They helped me to carry my husband to the tent, and
there we laid him, and I tried to make him as easy as was
possible under the circumstances, but comfort or rest was
altogether out of the question. All that night I sat beside
him, sometimes watching, sometimes falling into a fitful sleep.
I did not believe that he would live through the night. In
the morning he was by no means improved, and then I felt
too truly the abject misery of our position. It is a painful
thing to watch at the bedside of those we love when hope for
their recovery is gone; but think what it must be to sit upon
the cold earth in the tent, upon the open desert, with the
piercing wind of winter penetrating to the very bones, and there
before you, the dear one—your life, your all on earth—dying,
and you without a drop of medicine, or even a morsel of the
coarsest nourishment, to give him. Oh, the bitterness of my
soul at that moment! I tried to pray, but my heart was full
of cursing; it seemed to me as if even God Himself had forgotten
us. The fearful misery of that dark hour has left on
my soul itself a record as ineffaceable as the imprint of a burning
iron upon the flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“The morning broke at last, dark and dreary, and a thick
heavy mantle of snow covered all the camp; but we contrived
to communicate with each other, and soon it was whispered
that five poor creatures had been found dead in the tents.
Want, and weariness, and the bitter cold, had done their work,
and we did not weep for them—they were at rest; but for
ourselves we wept that we were left behind—and we looked
at one another, wistfully, wondering which of us would be
taken next.</p>

<p>“We buried those five poor frozen corpses in one grave,
wrapped in the clothing in which they died, and then we comforted
each other as best we might, and left the dead who
were now beyond our reach, that we might do what we could
for those who were fast following them to the grave. A
meeting of the leaders was held, and it was resolved that we
should remain where we were until the promised supplies
reached us. We could not, in fact, do otherwise, for the snow
was so deep that it was impossible for us to proceed, and the
sick and dying demanded immediate attention. That morning,
for the first time, no flour was distributed—there was
none. All that remained, besides our miserable cattle, was a
small quantity of hard biscuit which Captain Willie bought at
Laramie, and a few pounds of rice and dried apples. Nearly
all the biscuit was at once divided among the whole company,
and the few pounds which remained, together with the rice and
apples, were given to Elder Chislett for the use of the sick
and the very little children. They also killed two of the
cattle and divided the beef. Most of the people got through
their miserable allowance that very morning, and then they
had to fast.</p>

<p>“Captain Willie set out that morning with another Elder to
meet the coming supplies and hasten them on, and as we saw
them disappear in the distant west we almost felt as if our
last hope departed with them, so many chances there were that
we should never see them again.</p>

<p>“The whole of that long, long day I sat beside my husband
in the tent—and I might almost say I did no more. There
was nothing that I could do. The little bedding that was
allowed for both of us I made up into a couch for him; but
what a wretched makeshift it was! And I got from Elder
Chislett a few of the dried apples which had been reserved for
the sick; but it was not until nightfall that my husband was
capable of swallowing anything—and then, what nourishment
to give to a sick man! The day was freezing cold, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
had hardly anything on me, and had eaten nothing since the
day before; for my mind was so agitated that I do not think
the most delicate food would have tempted me. God alone
knows the bitterness of my heart as I sat there during all that
weary day. I never expected to see my husband open his
eyes again, and I thought that when evening came I would
lie down beside him, and we would take our last long sleep on
earth together.</p>

<p>“When night came on and all was dark I still sat there; I
dreaded to move lest I should learn the terrible truth—my
husband dead! I looked towards the place where I knew he
was lying, but I could see nothing. I listened, and I fancied
that I heard a gentle breathing—but it was only fancy. Then,
louder than the incessant moaning of the wind, I could hear in
the distance a fearful cry—a cry which had often chilled our
hearts at midnight on the plains—it was the wolves! The
darkness grew darker still—so thick that one could almost
feel it; the horror of death seemed stealing over all my senses.
Oh that there might be one long eternal night to blot out for
ever our miseries and our existence. I threw my hands
wildly above me, and cried bitterly, ‘Oh God, my God, <em>let me
die</em>!’</p>

<p>“God was nearer to me than I thought. As my hand dropped
lifelessly to the ground it touched some moving thing—it was
my husband’s hand—the same hand which I had watched in
the twilight, stiffening, as I thought, in death. The long, thin
fingers grasped my own, and though they were very, very cold,
I felt that life was in them; and as I stooped down to kiss
them I heard my husband’s voice, very weak and feeble, saying
in a whisper, ‘Mary.’ I threw myself upon his bosom.
In a moment the fear of death—the longing for death—the
wild and terrible thoughts, all had gone; the sound of that
voice was life to me, and forgetful of his weakness, forgetful of
everything but him, I threw myself upon his bosom and wept
tears of joy.</p>

<p>“Very carefully and gently I raised him up, and, in the
darkness, every whispered word conveyed more meaning to
my mind than all his eloquence in by-gone times. After some
time I persuaded him to take a little nourishment—miserable
stuff that it was—and presently he fell asleep again. I laid his
dear head upon the best pillow that I could make of some of
my own clothes, and then I slept a little myself—not much,
but it was more refreshing than any sleep that had visited my
eyes for a long time past—hope had come again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“The next morning my husband was evidently better, and
I knelt down beside him and thanked God for the miracle that
He had wrought; for was it not a miracle thus to raise my dead
to life again? How many stronger, stouter men than he had
I seen fall sick and die; but to me God had shown mercy in
my utmost need.</p>

<p>“We waited three long days for the return of Captain
Willie. My heart was so full of thankfulness that my husband
had been spared that I certainly did not feel so acutely the
misery with which I was surrounded as I otherwise should
have done; I was like the prisoner who feels happy in a reprieve
from death, but whose situation is nevertheless such as
would appear to any other person the most wretched in which
he could be placed. The misery that was suffered in that
camp was beyond the power of words to describe. On the
second day they gave us some more beef-rations, but they did
us little good. The beef was, of course, of the poorest, and,
eaten alone, it did not seem to satisfy hunger, and those who
were prostrated by dysentery, although they ate it ravenously,
suffered much in consequence afterwards.</p>

<p>“The number of the sick rapidly increased, and not a few
died from exhaustion; and really those seemed happiest who
were thus taken from the horrors which surrounded them.
Had it not been for the intense frost, we should all probably
have fallen victims to the intolerable atmosphere of the camp.
I would not even allow my mind to recall some of the scenes
which I witnessed at that time: scenes, the disgusting and
filthy horrors of which no decent words could describe.
When you consider the frightful condition in which we were,
the hunger and cold which we endured, you may perhaps be
able in a small degree to conjecture—as far as a person can
conjecture who has not himself suffered such things—what we
then passed through. I saw poor miserable creatures, utterly
worn out, dying in the arms of other forlorn and hopeless
creatures as wretched as themselves; I saw strong and honest,
honourable men, or who had once been such, begging of the
captain for the miserable scraps which had been saved for the
sick and the helpless children; I saw poor heart-broken
mothers freezing to death, but clasping as they died, in an
agony of loving woe, the torn and wretched remnants of clothing
which they still retained, around the emaciated forms of
their innocent babes—the mother-instinct strong in death;
and sometimes at night when, all unbidden, I see again in
dreams the awful sufferings of those poor God-forsaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
wretches, I start in horror and pray the Almighty rather
to blot out from my mind the memory of <em>all</em> the past, than to
let me ever recollect, if but in fancy, that fearful time.</p>

<p>“The third day came, and still no relief. There are mysterious
powers of endurance in human nature, weak as we often
deem it, but there is a point beyond which the bow, however
flexible, will not bend. It was evident that if no help arrived
speedily, the end was not far off.</p>

<p>“The sun was sinking behind the distant western hills, in
all the glory of the clear frosty atmosphere of the desert, and
many who gazed upon its beauty did so with a mournful interest,
believing that they would never again behold the light of day.
But at that moment some who were anxiously watching with
a last hope—watching for what they hardly dared expect to see—raised
a shout of joy. We knew what it was! Men, women,
and children rushed from their tents to welcome the approaching
waggons and our friends in time of need. Captain Willie
and the other Elder had found the rescue from Salt Lake overtaken
by the storm just as we were, but he had told them of our
terrible situation, and they had hastened on without a moment’s
delay. It was he and they, convoying good supplies, who now
approached us. The poor creatures shouted wildly for joy;
even the strong men shed tears; and the sisters, overcome with
the sudden change from death to life, flung themselves into the
arms of the brethren as they came into the camp and covered
them with kisses. Such happiness you never saw—every one
shaking hands and speaking joyfully—every one saying ‘God
bless you’ with a meaning such as is seldom attached to those
words.</p>

<p>“The supplies were to us more than food and clothing—they
were life itself. Elder John Chislett was appointed to
distribute the provisions and clothing, and everything was
placed in his hands. He gave out to us all that was immediately
necessary, but strongly cautioned us to be very moderate
in what we ate, as it was dangerous to go from the extreme of
fasting to a full meal. After supper the clothing and bedding
was fairly divided, and we felt more thankful for those little
comforts than a person, who had never endured as we had,
would have felt had he become suddenly the recipient of
boundless luxury.</p>

<p>“Two of the Elders who had held forth such delusive hopes
to the company, not long before, as I have already told you,
were with the brethren who came to our relief. I have never
ventured to ask how it was that they could hold out to us in
God’s name such promises, when they must have known after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a moment’s reflection, that they were utterly baseless; but I
think that probably they left their comfortable homes in Salt
Lake City and came across the stormy desert with supplies to
meet us, only to show practically how anxious they were to
atone for having led us astray. Next morning Elder Grant went
on east to meet the company following us, but Elder W. H.
Kimball took command of our company for the rest of the way.</p>

<p>“We could now journey but very slowly, for the road was
bad; the sick and weakly were, however, able to ride, and
altogether we suffered less. To some this change for the better
arrived too late—the mental and physical sufferings which they
had endured were too much for them. Poor souls! they alone
and their Father in heaven knew what they had passed through.
They seemed to have lost all consciousness, as if their faculties
had been numbed and stultified. We talked to them of the
past, but they looked at us with unmeaning eyes, as if we
spoke of something in which they had no interest; we tried
to lead their thoughts to Zion, and the promises of the Lord;
but it was all in vain. They turned from us with a look of
terrible apathy; and one or two, who partly seemed to understand,
only replied with an indifference painful to witness—‘Too
late, too late!’</p>

<p>“As we journeyed, the weather every day grew colder.
Many of the unfortunate people lost their fingers and toes, others
their ears; one poor woman lost her sight, and I was told of a
poor sick man who held on to the waggon-bars to save himself
from jolting, and had all his fingers frozen off. Few, if any, of
the people recovered from the effects of that frost. One morning
they found a poor old man who had vainly tried the evening
before to keep up with the rest. His corpse was not far
from the camp, but it had been sadly mangled by the wolves.
Then there came another snow-storm, only worse in proportion
as the weather was colder, and it was with the utmost difficulty
that we could be kept from freezing. We wrapped blankets
and anything else we could get around us, but the cold wind
penetrated to our very bones. I was told that some of the
people, even women and children, who lagged behind, were
whipped so as to make them keep up, and to keep life in them.
I did not see this myself; but I believe, if the story was true,
it was an act of mercy and not of cruelty, for to delay a moment
was fatal. The captain of our hundred more than once stayed
behind the company to bury some unfortunate person who died
on the road: how he ever got up with us again I cannot tell,
but he seemed to be as indefatigable in his labours as he was
wonderfully preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sometimes the carts came to a dead stand-still, and several
had to be fastened together and drawn by a united effort, and
in more than one instance the poor people gave up altogether;—they
were carried on, while they lived, as well as we could;
but their carts were abandoned. The stragglers came in slowly
to camp the night of the storm—the people from the Valley
even went back to fetch some in—and it was nearly six o’clock
in the morning before the last arrived.</p>

<p>“The next day we remained in camp, for there were so many
sick and dying that we could not proceed. Early in the morning
Elder Chislett and three other Elders went round to see
who was dead, that they might be buried. They found in the
tents fifteen corpses—all stiff and frozen. Two more died
during the day. A large square hole was dug, and they were
buried in it three abreast, and then they were covered with
leaves and earth, every precaution being taken to keep them
from the wolves. Few of the relatives of those who were dead
came to the burial—they did not seem to care—death had
become familiar to them, and personal misery precluded sorrow
for the dead.</p>

<p>“As we drew nearer to Salt Lake Valley we met more of
the brethren coming to our assistance. They supplied us with
all we needed, and then hastened on to meet those who followed
us. The atmosphere seemed to become sensibly warmer,
and our sufferings were proportionately less as we approached
Zion.</p>

<p>“What the feelings of others might have been when they
first saw the goal of our hopes—Zion of our prayers and songs—I
cannot tell. Weary, oh <em>so</em> weary I felt, but thankful,
more than thankful, that my husband’s life had been spared.
He was pale and sick, but he was with us still.</p>

<p>“I have written too much already, Sister Stenhouse. I
cannot tell you more now, but I may as well add that when
we left Iowa City we were about five hundred in all. Some
left us on the way. When we left Florence, and began the
journey across the Plains, we were over four hundred and
twenty, of which number we buried sixty-seven—a sixth of
the whole. The company which followed us, and to which I
have frequently alluded, fared worse than we. They numbered
six hundred when they started, but they buried one
hundred and fifty on the journey—one in every four. May
God grant that I may never again see such a sight as was presented
by the miserable remnant of that last company as they
came on slowly through the Cañon towards Salt Lake Valley.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">WE FORSAKE ALL, AND SET OUT FOR ZION:—OUR JOURNEY
ACROSS THE PLAINS.</span></h2>

<p>IT was with strange feelings of doubt and unrest that I read
that painful story; but I folded up Mary Burton’s letter and
stored it carefully away in my desk, and then I began to think.</p>

<p>Certainly I was still a Mormon—at least I was nothing else—but
I was not now so firmly grounded in my faith as once
I was, and these terrible stories completely unsettled my mind.
Then, too, I was well aware that, before long, my husband and
myself would be called upon to cross the Plains to Zion, and I
felt that if our experience were anything like that of Mary
Burton, I and my children would never reach Salt Lake. The
prospect was not very cheering.</p>

<p>One morning we were surprised to receive a visit from the
Apostle George Q. Cannon, who had come to take the place
of Mr. Stenhouse as President of the Mission in the Eastern
States, and we were now to prepare to travel with the next
company of emigrants.</p>

<p>To me this was most unpleasant intelligence. Polygamy—the
knowledge that before long I should be brought personally
within its degrading influence—had now for years been the
curse of my life, and I had welcomed every reprieve from immediate
contact with it in Utah. But the time had come at
last when I was to realize my worst apprehensions, and I think
at that time, had I been permitted to choose, I would have preferred
to die rather than journey to Zion. Besides this, ever
since my husband had been engaged with the secular papers,
we had been getting along very comfortably. We had now a
pleasant home and many comforts and little luxuries which we
had not enjoyed since we left Switzerland, and I was beginning
to hope that we should be allowed to remain in New York for a
few years at least. We had also by this time six children—the
youngest only a few days old—and I leave it to any mother to
determine whether I had not good cause for vexation when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was told that we were expected to leave New York within
two weeks, with the emigrants who were then <i lang="fr">en route</i> from
England. My husband also was to take charge of the company,
and therefore everything would depend upon me—all the
preparations for our long and perilous journey, the disposal of
our furniture, and, in fact, the thousand and one little necessary
duties which must attend the packing up and departure of a
family.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days the emigrants arrived, and then
my husband was compelled to devote all his time to them.
When I told the Elders that it was almost impossible for me,
in the delicate state of health in which I was, and with a babe
only two weeks old, to undertake such a journey, they told
me that I had no faith in the power of God, and that if I
would arise and begin my preparations, the Lord would give
me strength according to my day. Thinking that probably my
husband believed as they did, I made the effort, but it cost me
much. In the Mormon Church the feelings or sufferings of
women are seldom considered. If an order is given to any man
to take a journey or perform any given task, his wife or wives
are not to be thought of. They are his property just as much
as his horses, mules, or oxen; and if one wife should die, it is
of little consequence if he has others, and if he has not he can
easily get them; and if he is not young or fascinating enough
to win his way with the young ladies, he has only to keep on
good terms with Brigham Young, or even with his bishop, and
every difficulty will be smoothed away, and they will be “counselled”
to marry him.</p>

<p>It is never expected, nor would it be tolerated in any Mormon
woman, that she should exercise her own judgment in opposition
to her husband, no matter how much she might feel
that he was in the wrong: I have frequently seen intelligent
women subjected to the grossest tyranny on the part of ignorant
and fanatical husbands who were influenced by the absurd
teachings of the Tabernacle. One of the greatest Mormon
writers, Orson Pratt, has said,—</p>

<p>“<em>The wife should never follow her own judgment in preference
to that of her husband</em>; for if her husband desires to do right,
but errs in judgment, the Lord will bless her in endeavouring
to carry out his counsels; for <em>God has placed him at the head</em>,
and though he may err in judgment, yet God will not justify
the wife in disregarding his instructions and counsels; far
greater is the sin of rebellion, than the errors which arise from
the want of judgment; therefore <em>she would be condemned for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
suffering her will to rise against his. Be obedient</em>, and God will
cause all things to work for good.”</p>

<p>The trouble and annoyance occasioned by leaving a comfortable
position in New York to travel to such an unknown region
as Utah was then, was not a trifle; but we hastened our preparations,
sacrificing all that we possessed in the most reckless
manner, and in due time set out.</p>

<p>When we reached Florence—the starting-point on the Frontiers—we
were detained on account of some mismanagement
on the part of the Church Agents, and remained for three
weeks in camp. Ours was what was called “an independent
company;” by which I mean that we were able to defray our
own expenses without borrowing from the Church: the poorer
emigrants were assisted from a fund provided for that purpose—the
Perpetual Emigration Fund.</p>

<p>Our company was in an infinitely better position than that
of those emigrants of whose sad fate my friend Mary Burton
had told me; for our journey was made at the proper season,
and, as far as was possible under the circumstances, convenience
and comfort had been attended to. The incidents which befell
us were few, and although, of course, every one of us felt
weary and worn out, we were not called upon to pass through
the miseries and sufferings endured by the hand-cart emigrants.
Looking back to our primitive mode of travelling, it appears
to me almost as if I must be making some mistake about my
own age, and that it must have been several centuries, instead
of a few years ago, since we crossed the Plains. The ox-team
and waggon, the walk on foot in the day and the camp-life at
night, have been pleasantly exchanged for the swift travel of a
few days in a Pullman palace-car.</p>

<p>What living contradictions we were as we crossed the Plains—singing
in a circle, night and morning, the songs of Zion and
listening to prayers and thanksgivings for having been permitted
to gather out of Babylon; and then during the day as
we trudged along in twos and threes expressing to each other
all our misgivings, and doubts, and fears, and the bitterness
our thoughts against Polygamy; while each wife, confiding in
her husband’s honour and faithfulness, solaced herself with the
hope that all might yet be well. How little sometimes do the
songs of gladness reflect the real sentiments of the heart. How
often have I heard many a poor heart-broken woman singing
the chorus,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I never knew what joy was</div>
<div class="verse">Till I became a Mormon.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>I never could sing that song, for my experience had been
exactly the reverse.</p>

<p>It was the month of September—the beginning of our
beautiful Indian summer—when we emerged from the cañon,
and caught sight of Salt Lake City. Everything looked green
and lovely, and in spite of all my sad forebodings while crossing
the Plains, I involuntarily exclaimed, “Ah, what a glorious
spot!” It looked like a beautiful garden—another Eden—in
the midst of a desert valley. We had a glimpse of the Great
Salt Lake far away in the distance, stretching out like a placid
sheet of molten silver, while everywhere around were the
lonely-looking snow-clapped mountains, encircling us like
mighty prison-walls.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me to describe my feelings at
that time. Even while I was enchanted with the glorious
prospect before me, there arose again in my mind that haunting
spectre of my existence—Polygamy. I believed that this
little earthly paradise would probably be to me, and my
daughters after me, a prison-house, and with a mother’s instinct
I shuddered as I thought of what they might be destined to
suffer there. Lovely as the scene was, there was a fatal shadow
overhanging it all. Then, too, there was no escape: if the
sad forebodings of my heart were realized, it would be utterly
impossible for us ever to get away. The idea of a railway
being constructed across those desert plains and rocky mountains
never for a moment entered my mind, and even had I
thought it possible, I should have supposed that it would take
a lifetime to complete. No, there was no help for me, even
if it came to the worst. I felt that my doom was sealed; and
there were many women in our company who thought just the
same as I did, and who were troubled at heart with fears as sad
as mine.</p>

<p>My first impressions of Salt Lake City when we began life
there were anything but pleasant—we had to “rough it.” For
nearly two weeks we were obliged to remain in our waggons,
as it was quite impossible to obtain house-room. At that time
each family built their own little hut, and there were no
vacant houses to let.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VIEW OF MAIN STREET, SALT LAKE CITY.<br />
(<i>From a Photograph.</i>)</p>
<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 148.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The weather was now growing very cold and wintry, and it
was absolutely necessary that we should have some better
shelter than the waggons afforded. One day my husband told
me, when he came home, that he had been offered a house
which belonged to the Church. It was in a very dilapidated
condition, he said, but that if I would go and look at it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
him, we could then decide about taking it. No time was to
be lost, for companies of emigrants were coming in almost
daily, and if we neglected this chance we might not find
another.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the house I was much discouraged at
seeing the condition it was in: the window-panes were all
cracked or broken out, the floors and walls looked as if they
had never known soap or paint, and the upper rooms had no
ceilings; in fact it was not fit for any civilized Christian to
live in. In point of size there was nothing to complain of,
but of comfort or convenience there was none—the wind
whistled through every door and every cracked window; and
altogether it presented anything but a cheering prospect for
winter.</p>

<p>My husband told me that Daniel H. Wells, who was superintendent
of Church property and also one of the First
Presidency of the Church, had promised him that if we took
the house it should be repaired and made fit for living in before
winter fully set in; and under the circumstances we thought
we could do no better than accept his offer.</p>

<p>Thus we began housekeeping in Utah, and we unpacked
our trunks and tried to give the place as home-like an appearance
as we possibly could. I had known what it was to be in
a strange country and destitute; and, therefore, benefiting by
experience, when I left New York, regardless of the teachings
of the Elders and of my own husband’s directions to the contrary,
I had secretly stowed away many little necessaries
towards housekeeping. Indeed had I not done so, we should
have been as badly off when we reached Zion as when we arrived
in New York. Besides which, I have no doubt that our
waggons would have been filled with the trunks of those very
brethren who counselled us not to take more than was absolutely
necessary. The brethren who gave this counsel were,
I noticed, constantly purchasing while they advised every one
else to sell, and I thought it wiser to follow their example than
their precepts.</p>

<p>Among my treasures was some carpet, and when that was
laid down and the stove put up we began to feel almost at
home. The wind, however, soon drove away all thoughts of
comfort, for it came whistling in through a thousand undetected
crevices, and the tallow candles which we were obliged
to burn presented a woeful spectacle. Even the most wealthy,
then, had no other light but candles, and every family had to
make their own: I have often seen people burning a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
melted grease with a bit of cotton-rag stuck in the middle
for a wick—how pleasant the smell, and how brilliant the light
thus produced can be imagined. Everything was upon the
same scale—and to keep house in any fashion was really a
formidable undertaking, especially to those who had been accustomed
to the conveniences of large towns. I believe that
many women consented to their husbands taking other wives
for the sake of getting some assistance in their home duties.</p>

<p>We spent nearly all the first evening in our new house in
trying to discover some means of keeping out the storm,
but to little purpose. Nearly a fortnight passed before any one
came to see about repairing the house, but as it belonged to the
Church my husband seemed to think it must be all right.
The Mormon men are always very lenient towards “the
Church”—very much more so than the Mormon women, for
the latter have somehow got mixed up in their minds the idea
that Brigham Young and “the Church” are synonymous
terms. I remember one day a good young sister—a daughter
of one of the twelve Apostles—saying to me, “I have just seen
the Church,” and when I asked her what she meant, she said,
“I have just met Brigham Young and Hyram Clawson, and
are they not the Church?” It was evident to me that others
besides myself sometimes gave way to wicked thoughts.
Nevertheless I was still of opinion that “the Church” had
plenty of money and ought to have repaired the house.</p>

<p>One day a man whom I had never seen before, called upon
me and asked what repairs I should like done. I was not
feeling very well, and had been annoyed at the delay, and I
answered rather ungraciously that I should like anything done,
if it were only done at once, for I thought we had waited long
enough. He answered me very politely, and said that he would
see to it immediately. When Mr. Stenhouse returned home in
the evening, he said, “So you have had a visit from President
Wells.” “No,” I said, “there has been no one here but a carpenter—an
ugly man with a cast in his eye, and I told him that
I wanted the house fixed right away.”</p>

<p>“Why, that was President Wells,” he said, very much
shocked, and I think I felt as bad as he did when I realized
that I had treated one of the “First Presidency” so unceremoniously.</p>

<p>This Daniel H. Wells, besides being an Apostle, a Counsellor
of Brigham Young, and one of the three “Presidents” who
share with Brigham the first position in the Church, and are associated
with him in all his official acts, was Lieutenant-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the Nauvoo Legion, and at the present time and for some
years past Mayor of Salt Lake City. It was a shocking indiscretion,
to say the least, to speak slightingly of such a high and
mighty personage.</p>

<p>The repairs, however, were seen to, and the house rendered
a little more habitable. We had now to begin the struggle of
life afresh, and could not afford to be too particular about
trifles;—to obtain shelter was something—for the rest we
must still continue to hope and trust.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE CITY OF THE SAINTS.</span></h2>

<p>When I arrived in Salt Lake City, a great many improvements
had been effected; and expecting, as I did that this
would be our future home for many years, perhaps for life, I
was interested in everything that I saw.</p>

<p>The first Sunday I went to the Tabernacle I was greatly
amused at the way in which some of the sisters were dressed.
Quite a number wore sun-bonnets, but the majority wore
curious and diverse specimens of the milliner’s art—relics of
former days. Some wore a little tuft of gauze and feathers
on the top of the head, while others had helmets of extraordinary
size. There were little bonnets, half-grown bonnets,
and “grandmother bonnets” with steeple crowns and fronts
so large that it was difficult to get a peep at the faces which
they concealed. As for the dresses, they were as diversified
as the bonnets. Some of them presented a rather curious
spectacle. I noticed two young women who sat near me:
they were dressed alike in green calico sun-bonnets, green
calico skirts, and pink calico sacks. On inquiring who they
were, I was told that they were the wives of one man, and had
both been married to him on the same day, so that neither
could claim precedence of the other. Outside of Utah such
a thing would seem impossible; but so many of the young
girls at that time came out to Zion without father or mother or
any one else to guide them; and left to their own inexperience
and afraid to disobey “counsel,” it is no wonder that they soon
yielded to the universal custom.</p>

<p>The two young women whom I have mentioned did not
appear to me to be overburdened with intelligence; they
looked like girls who could be made to believe anything; but
after that I met with two well-educated women who, like
these foolish girls, thoughtlessly tried the experiment of two
or more marrying the same man on the same day, agreeing
with their “lord” that that would be the best way to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
peace in their household. But they were terribly mistaken;
and even before the marriage-day was over, the poor bewildered
husband had to fly to Brother Brigham for counsel.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle services seemed to me as strange as the
women. There was no regular order in conducting the proceedings,
but the prominent brethren made prayers or “sermons”
as they were called upon to do so. The “sermons”
would be more properly called speeches; they are nothing
but a rambling, disconnected glorification of the Saints, interspersed
with fearful denunciations of the Gentiles, and not
unfrequently a good sprinkling of words and expressions such
as are never used in decent society. More unedifying discourses
could hardly be imagined. As for the spirituality
and devotional feeling which characterized our meetings in
England, they were only conspicuous by their absence, and
many devout Saints have told me that when they first went
there, before the erection of the great organ, the free-and-easy
manners of the speakers and the brass band which was
stationed in front of the platform, made them feel as if they
had come to witness a puppet-show rather than to attend a
religious meeting.</p>

<p>There was one lady at the Tabernacle service whom I regarded
with considerable interest. This was no other than
Eliza R. Snow, one of the Prophet’s wives. I was told that
she was the first woman married in Polygamy after Joseph
Smith received the Revelation, and I believed it was so.
People who lived in Nauvoo, respectable people, and not one
or two either, have assured me that for four years before
Joseph is said to have received the Revelation, he was practising
Polygamy, or something worse, and that the Revelation
was given to justify what was already done. However this
might be, it is generally understood that Miss Eliza Snow
was the first plural wife of the Prophet. Her principal
occupation at the present time is converting rebellious wives
to obedience to their husbands, and convincing young girls
that it is their duty to enter into Polygamy. Unhappy husbands
derive great consolation from her counsels. In matters
of religion she is a perfect fanatic, and in connexion with
the Female Relief Society she reigns supreme; but otherwise
there are many excellent traits in her character, and I could
tell of many acts of loving-kindness and self-denial which she
has performed, and which will surely have their reward. As
the chief poet of the Mormon Church, and as the Representative
of Eve in the mysteries of the Endowment House, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
enjoys a reputation such as would be impossible to any other
woman among the Saints.</p>

<p>Another of the late Joseph’s wives is a Mrs. Doctor Jacobs,
who was actually married to the Prophet while she was still
living with her original husband, Jacobs. Under the same
circumstances she married Brigham Young, after Joseph’s
death. For some time her husband knew nothing of the
whole affair, but Brigham very soon gave him to understand
that his company was not wanted. The sister of Mrs.
Jacobs—a Mrs. Buel—was another of Joseph’s wives, and
she married the Apostle Heber C. Kimball, but does not
appear to have made a very good bargain.</p>

<p>Besides these there is another lady, a Mrs. Shearer—or, as
she is familiarly called—“Aunty Shearer.” She is in every
respect a unique specimen of womanhood, tall and angular,
with cold yet eager grey eyes; a woman of great volubility,
and altogether grim-looking and strong-minded. She was an
early disciple, and is said to have sacrificed everything for
Mormonism. She lived in Joseph Smith’s family, and, of
course, saw and heard a great deal about Polygamy, and at
first it was a great stumbling-block to her. She was, however,
instructed by the immaculate Joseph, and so far
managed to overcome her feelings as to be married to him for
eternity. Like the others, she is called “Mrs.,” and I suppose
there is a <em>Mr.</em> Shearer somewhere, but upon that point
she is very reticent. Her little lonely hut is fitted with innumerable
curiosities and little knick-knacks, which some people
are for ever hoarding away in the belief that they will come
into use some day. She is a woman that one could not easily
forget. She wears a muslin cap with a very wide border
flapping in the wind under a comical-looking hood, and is
easily recognized by her old yellow marten-fur cape and enormous
muff: her dress, which is of her own spinning and
weaving, is but just wide enough, and its length could never
inconvenience her. Add to these personal ornaments a stout pair
of brogues, and you will see before you “Aunty Shearer,”
one of the Prophet’s spiritual wives.</p>

<p>I may as well explain what is meant by “spiritual” wives
and “proxy” wives.</p>

<p>Marriages contracted by the Gentiles, or by Mormons in
accordance with Gentile institutions, are not considered binding
by the Saints. That was partly the cause of my indignation
and the indignation of many another wife and mother.
We were told that we had never been married at all, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
our husbands and our children were not lawfully ours: surely
that was enough to excite the indignation of any wife, whatever
her faith might be. For a marriage to be valid it must
be solemnized in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City, or
the persons contracting it can never expect to be husband and
wife in eternity. Should the husband die before he reaches
Zion, and if the wife loves him sufficiently well to wish to be
his in eternity—when she arrives in Salt Lake City, if she
receives an offer of marriage from one of the brethren, and
does not object to him as a second husband in this world, she
will make an agreement with him that she will be his wife,
<em>for time</em>, but that in eternity she and all her children shall be
handed over to the first husband. A woman thus married
is called a “proxy” wife.</p>

<p>Now “spiritual” wives are of two classes. The one consists
of old ladies who have plenty of money or property which
of course needs looking after; and generous Elders marry
them, and accordingly “look after” the said property, and
the owner of it becomes the Elder’s <em>spiritual</em> wife. She will
only be his <em>real</em> wife in eternity when she is rejuvenated.</p>

<p>The other kind of “spiritual” wife is one who is married
already, but who does not think that her husband can “exalt”
her to so high a position in the celestial world as she deserves—perhaps
some kind brother who takes a great interest in her
welfare has told her so—she then is <em>secretly</em> “<em>sealed</em>” to one of
the brethren who is better able to exalt her—perhaps to this
same brother; and in the resurrection she will pass from him
who was her husband on earth to him who is to be her husband
in heaven—<em>if she has not done so before</em>.</p>

<p>This is what is meant by “proxy” and “spiritual” wives.
I think it will be evident even to the dullest comprehension
that under such a system, “the world, the flesh, and the
devil” are far more likely to play a prominent part than anything
heavenly or spiritual.</p>

<p>All this is so repugnant to the instincts and feelings of a
true woman, that I feel quite ashamed to write about it. And
yet the working out of this system has produced results which
would be perfectly grotesque were it not that they outrage
every ordinary sense of propriety. Let me give an example.
One of the wives of Brigham Young—Mrs. Augustus Cobb
Young—a highly educated and intelligent Boston lady with
whom I am intimately acquainted, requested of her Prophet
husband a favour of a most extraordinary description. She
had forsaken her lawful husband and family and a happy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
luxurious home to join the Saints, under the impression that
Brigham Young would make her his queen in heaven. She
was a handsome woman—a woman of many gifts and graces—and
Brigham thoroughly appreciated her; but she made a
slight miscalculation in respect to the Prophet. He cares
little enough for his first wife, poor lady, and few people who
know him doubt for a moment that he would un-queen her
and cut her adrift for time and eternity too, if his avaricious
soul saw the slightest prospect of gain by doing so; he did not
care for her, but he never would allow himself to be dictated
to by any woman. So when the lady of whom I speak asked
him to place her at the head of his household, he refused: she
begged hard, but he would not relent. Then finding that she
could not be Brigham’s “queen,” and having been taught by
the highest Mormon authorities that our Saviour had, and
has, many wives, she requested to be “sealed to Him!” Brigham
Young told her (for what reason I do not know) that it
really was out of his power to do that, but that he would do
“the next best thing” for her—he would “seal” her to Joseph
Smith. She was sealed to Joseph Smith, and though Brigham
still supports her, and she is called by his name on
earth, in the resurrection she will leave him and go over to
the original Prophet.</p>

<p>The reader will be certainly shocked at this terrible
burlesque of sacred things, but I felt it my duty to state the
truth and place facts in their right light. It is not generally
known that the Mormons are taught that the marriage at Cana
of Galilee was Christ’s own nuptial feast, that Mary and
Martha were his plural wives, and that those women who in
various parts of the New Testament are spoken of as ministering
to him stood to him in the same relation.</p>

<p>Malicious first wives, especially if they are rather elderly
themselves, frequently call the proxy wives “fixins;” and
the tone in which some of them utter the word is in the last
degree contemptuous. These poor “fixins” are seldom
treated as real wives by the husband himself. He may think
sufficiently well of the “proxy” wife to make her his for
time and to raise up children to his friend, as the Elders say,
but he never forgets that in eternity she will be handed over
to the man for whom he has stood proxy, and he expects that
she also will bear that in mind, and do all she can for her own
support, and never complain of his want of attention to her.
Some men, after having married a young proxy wife, have
become so enamoured that they grew jealous of the dead husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and have tried to get the wife to break faith with him,
and be married to them for eternity as well as time. This
was certainly rather mean. Very few Gentile husbands
would fret themselves about possibilities in the world to come,
if in this world they had the certainty of enjoying the undivided
affections of their wives.</p>

<p>Mormon husbands are so influenced by their religion that
they neither act nor think like other men. I am thinking of
one wretched family that I knew soon after I went to Utah.
There was a man and his wife and four children, all living together
in a miserable, poverty-stricken hut. I had heard that
the man was paying attentions to a young girl with a view of
making her his second wife, and I frequently watched the
first wife as she went in and out, doing her “chores,” and wondered
how she felt about it. The poverty of the man, of
course, was of no consequence; living in the primitive style
in which necessity then compelled the Saints to live, one, or
even half-a-dozen extra wives made very little difference, and
Brigham and the leading Elders have always represented it as
a meritorious act, for the young especially, to “build up the
kingdom,” without regard to consequences, or the misery of
bringing up a family in a destitute condition. I never can
see children without loving them, and in this case it was not
long before I contrived to make acquaintance with the little
ones. One day, while I was talking to them, the mother came
out. She seemed pleased to see me, for she had heard of me
that I was not too strong in the faith, and she told me that
her husband had said, in speaking of such women as myself,
who did not like the celestial order of marriage, that their
husbands ought to force them right into it, and that would
show what they were made of: if they were true-hearted
women, seeking their husband’s glory and “exaltation” in the
world to come, they would bear it well enough; and if not,
the sooner it killed them the better; for if they were dead
their husbands could save them in the resurrection, but if they
lived they would only be an incumbrance.</p>

<p>This, I found, was the general opinion among the Mormon
men. Even in England the American Elders had taught us
that the man was the head and “saviour” of the woman, and
that the woman was only responsible to her husband. It was
necessary, we were told, that the woman should keep in
favour with her lord, otherwise he might withdraw his protection
and refuse to take her into the celestial kingdom; in
which case when she got to heaven she would only be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
angel! To be an angel is not considered by the Saints to
be by any means the highest state of glory. Those who do
not obey the “Celestial Order of Marriage” will, like the angels,
neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be located,
the men in one place, and the women in another, and will
serve as slaves, lackeys, and boot-blacks to the Saints. Brigham
Young once publicly said of a certain President of the
United States, that he would clean the boots of the Mormon
leaders in heaven. He did not say this as a figure of speech,
but meant it literally. Those who have obeyed the Gospel of
the new dispensation, but who have failed to enter into Polygamy,
will be as upper servants; but the rebellious—the “vile
apostates” and the “wicked Gentiles”—will join the angels
and do all the drudgery for the men of many wives. Thus I
learned in Zion that my youthful notions about the glory of
the cherubim were quite a mistake, and that it was not such
a fine thing to be an angel after all.</p>

<p>But I have run away from my story, and had almost forgotten
my poor acquaintance. She was a woman who was
likely to preserve a painful place in the memory of any one
who once saw her. Her face was pale as death, and her jet-black
eyes glistened with an unearthly lustre; it was easy to
perceive that she was very unhappy, although she tried hard to
exhibit a cheerful disposition, and when our conversation
turned to that subject which to women here is all-absorbing, the
nervous twitching of her pale face showed how deeply painful
such thoughts were to her. She told me that her husband
was soon to be married to a young girl about fourteen years
of age. “Do you see,” she said, “that he is building for
her?” And sure enough he was, at odd hours, adding
another hut to the miserable hovel in which they already lived;
and thither, when it was finished, he intended to take his
bride. As I looked at the poor wife, I felt little doubt that
ere that time came, her troubles on earth would have ended,
and her little ones would be motherless.</p>

<p>The Mormon women, as well as the Mormon men, are noted
for attending to their own business—they do not care to tell
their sorrows and trials to strangers or to people who are not
of their own faith. In this way visitors to Salt Lake who
have gone there with the intention of “writing-up” the Saints
in the newspapers or in a book, have generally been misled.
My own experience as a Mormon woman leads me to form
anything but a flattering opinion of the Mormon stories told
by Gentile pens. The following instance will show that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
sisters are not quite so free in giving their experience as
some writers would suggest.</p>

<p>One day, while passing through the city, I saw a young
woman running across the road with a little child in her arms.
The child was crying piteously, for the water was running
from its clothing, and I saw in a moment that it had fallen
into the stream which ran in front of the house. I followed,
to see if I could be of any assistance, but fortunately found
that the little creature was not seriously hurt, but would
soon recover from the fright and cold. I helped the mother
to change its clothing, and while she was lulling her baby to
sleep we entered into conversation. At first she appeared to
be very shy of me, and avoided speaking of anything in the
slightest degree personal; but growing more interested, she
said at last,—</p>

<p>“Are you a Mormon?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I answered; “but why do you ask me?”</p>

<p>“Because,” she said, “we have had one or two Gentile
women among us, and they go round among our people
and question the women, and get them to tell their troubles,
which God knows are heavy enough; and then they go and
write about it, and Brigham Young finds it out, and their
husbands are called to account for allowing their wives to speak
to the Gentiles. You are sure you are a Mormon?” she
added, “and you are not deceiving me?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you should think such a thing,” I said; “but if
you suppose I would deceive you, I will not trouble you with
my company.” And I rose up to leave.</p>

<p>“Do not go yet,” she said, “and pray forgive me, if I have
wounded your feelings; it is simply the fear I have of getting
into trouble. Brigham Young and the Elders have frequently
told us to have nothing to do with the Gentiles, for they are
enemies to the kingdom of God, and are seeking our overthrow—and
I suppose it is true.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been here?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Over two years,” she replied, “and it seems almost twenty—time
has passed so slowly. I left father and mother, sisters
and brother, for the Gospel’s sake, and I do not regret it, because
it is right; but it was a very great sacrifice to make.
Yet I believe that God blesses us for the sacrifices we make,
and I shall get my reward.”</p>

<p>“You have it already,” I said, “in that pretty child on your
knee; and your husband, I hope, is a good man and kind to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, “my child is a very great source of
happiness to me, and I love my husband very much, but—”
(hesitatingly) “are <em>you</em> in Polygamy?”</p>

<p>“No, not yet; but I do not know how soon my husband may
take it into his head to get another wife.”</p>

<p>“Are you first wife?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “and I suppose you are also?”</p>

<p>“No, I am third wife,” she said, “I wish I were first
wife.”</p>

<p>“But why,” I suggested, “do you wish that? If Polygamy
is the true order of marriage, I do not see that it
makes much difference whether one is the first or the twentieth
wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, yes,” she replied, “it <em>does</em> make a great deal of
difference; for the first wife will be queen over all the others,
and reign with her husband. If I had known that before I was
married, I should have made my husband promise to place
me first. Men can do that if they like.”</p>

<p>“But do you think you would be doing right in trying to
gain the position of first wife in that way?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she said; “didn’t Jacob obtain his brother’s
birthright by deception—and was he ever punished for it?
Do you think that Brother Brigham, notwithstanding that
he is the inspired servant of God, could have obtained his
position, and all his money, by simple honest dealing? If
you think so, I don’t; and it is just as proper and right for
us women to secure a position for ourselves by such means
as it is for Brigham Young—the end justifies the means.”</p>

<p>“If that is so,” I said, “it is a wonder to me that any
woman should consent to become second, third, or fourth wife—seeing
they cannot be queens.”</p>

<p>“I can see that you have not yet had your ‘Endowments,’”
she said, “or you would understand more about these things;
but as you are a good Mormon, I can speak freely to you.
You see it is not always those who are first wives in this
world who will be first in the celestial kingdom. It all depends
upon the amount of sacrifice the wife is capable of making
for her husband, her faithfulness to him, and the number
of children she has borne him. If she pleases him in every
particular, and is good, patient, and above all things obedient
to all his wishes and commands, then she is almost certain to
be made queen, unless the first wife is just as good, and then
I don’t know how they would fix that. And so you see it is
safer to be first wife at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, but,” I asked, “knowing all this, I am surprised
that you consented to be third wife!”</p>

<p>“But I did not know it then,” she continued. “My husband
told me that <em>all</em> the wives were queens—all equal—and
he says so still when I talk to him about it. But he can’t
deceive me. I have spoken to some of the old Nauvoo women
who know all about it, and they tell me that all the Polygamic
wives will be subject to the first wife; but the first wife,
having suffered most, will be the one who has gone through
the fire and been purified, and found worthy.”</p>

<p>“But do you think that your husband would wish to deceive
you about such an important matter?” I said.</p>

<p>“Wait till you have lived a little longer here,” she replied,
“and you will be able to answer that question yourself, or
else your experience will be very different from that of the
rest of the people here.”</p>

<p>Just then the husband made his appearance, and put an end
to the conversation. He was a tall, dark-looking man, with
grey hair, old enough to be her father. He appeared to be
well educated and to have seen better days, though everything
about their home indicated poverty—the room in which
we were sitting had no carpet on the floor, there was a plain
white-pine table in the middle, a small sheet-iron stove, four
wooden chairs, a small looking-glass, and some cheap pictures.
This was the sitting-room for the whole family—three wives,
eleven children, one husband. He asked me if I had seen
the rest of the family.</p>

<p>I replied negatively, and he said he would see if any of them
were about. Presently he returned accompanied by an elderly
woman whom he introduced as Mrs. Simpson. Then came
another, not quite as good-looking as the first, but a great
deal younger, and he introduced her as “My wife Ellen.
And this one,” he said, turning to the one with whom I had
been conversing, “is my wife Sarah. Don’t you think I have
got three fine-looking women?” Then, after a pause, he
added, “And they are just as good as they are good-looking—good,
obedient wives. I have no trouble with them; my
wishes are law in this house. Here you have a family in
which the Spirit of God reigns. We are not rich in worldly
goods, as you see, but we are laying up treasure in heaven.
We all live in this little home of four rooms. My wife Ellen
here, has given up her room for a parlour for us all to meet together
in, and she sleeps in a waggon-box; it is not the most
comfortable, but she never grumbles. Then, here is our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Sarah; we are obliged to humour her a little, and give her a
room all to herself. She is young and inexperienced, and
doesn’t like to put up with the inconveniences that the
Saints have to bear with; while old mother here has got to
have half-a-dozen children in her room, but she never complains.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not wait,” I said, “until you had a larger
house?”</p>

<p>“Then where would my kingdom be?” he answered,
“Young men may wait, but old men must improve their
time.”</p>

<p>There came in now a troop of children of all ages. They
had been playing in the lot, were miserably clad, barefooted,
and some looked gaunt and hungry:—manners to
match. “These,” he said, with all a father’s fondness—“these
constitute my kingdom, and I am proud of them.”</p>

<p>I felt thankful that I was not destined to be queen over
such a kingdom, wished them good-bye, and with a sad heart
went home to my own darling little ones, not knowing what
might be <em>their</em> fate.</p>

<span class="smaller">BRIGHAM YOUNG AT HOME:—WE VISIT THE PROPHET AND
HIS WIVES.</span></h2>

<p>Shortly after our arrival in Salt Lake City we visited President
Young, who received us very graciously and appointed
an early day for us to dine with him.</p>

<p>On that occasion he invited some of the Apostles and leading
men to meet us at his table, and we passed an exceedingly
pleasant evening. The Prophet made himself very affable;
talked with us about our missionary life and other subjects of
personal and general interest; and expressed a high opinion
of the energy and ability which my husband had displayed.
His wives, too,—whom I found, as far as I could judge from
such a casual acquaintance, to be amiable and kind-hearted
ladies,—made every effort to render our visit agreeable.</p>

<p>I was much pleased with the manner and appearance of
Brigham Young, and felt greatly reassured; for he did not
seem to me like a man who would preach and practise such
things as I had heard of him while I was in London. This I
was glad to see, for it encouraged me to think that, perhaps,
after all, matters might not be so bad as I had anticipated.
We were, in fact, very kindly received in Salt Lake City by
every one with whom we came in contact; for having been
Missionaries for so many years, we were, of course, well known
by name, and had a wide circle of acquaintances among the
chief Elders and emigrants.</p>

<p>Fifteen years have, of course, worked a great change in the
appearance of Brigham Young; but though he is now nearly
seventy-three years of age, he is still a portly-looking—I might
almost say handsome man. His good looks are not of the
poetic or romantic kind at all; he is very common-place and
practical in his appearance, but long and habitual exercise of
despotic authority has stamped itself upon his features, and is
seen even in the way he carries himself: he might without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
any stretch of the imagination be mistaken for a retired sea-captain.</p>

<p>When I first knew him, in appearance he was little over
fifty years of age, was of medium height, well built, upright,
and, as I just stated, had the air of one accustomed to be
obeyed. His hair was light,—sandy, I suppose I ought to call
it,—with eyes to match; and the expression of his countenance
was pleasant and manly. I, of course, regarded him
from a woman’s stand-point; but there were others who were
accustomed to study physiognomy, and they detected—or
thought they detected—in the cold expression of his eye and
the stern, hard lines of his lips, evidences of cruelty, selfishness,
and dogged determination which, it is only fair to say, I
myself never saw.</p>

<p>The lines on his face have deepened of late years, as what
little of gentleness his heart ever knew has died out within
him; but still he presents the appearance of a man who would
afford a deep study to the observer of human nature. In
early life he had to work hard for a living, and according to
his own statement he had a rough time of it. He was, by
trade, a painter and glazier, and has frequently said in public
that in those times he was glad to work for “six bits” a day,
and to keep his hands busy from morning to night to get even
that. Whether or not the privations of early years fostered
in him that avaricious and grasping spirit which of late years
has been so conspicuous in him, I cannot say, but it is certain
that it cropped out very early in his career as a Saint. An
old Nauvoo Missionary,—a Mormon of the Mormons once,
but now, alas! a “vile apostate” as Brigham would politely
call him,—once told me that when the Prophet Joseph Smith
sent the Apostle Young on Mission, a good deal of discontent
was shown that the said Apostle did not account properly for
the collections and tithings which passed through his hands.
Brother Joseph who was <em>then</em> “the Church” suggested in a
pleasant way—for the Prophet Smith was a big, jovial fellow,
six feet two or three inches in height, and withal somewhat of
a humorist—that the said Apostle Brigham would appear in
his eyes a better Saint if he displayed a little less love for
filthy lucre. Thereupon the Apostle, like somebody else who
shall be nameless, quoted Scripture, and reminded the Prophet
that Moses had said, “Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the
ox that treadeth out the corn.” “True, Brother Brigham,”
said Joseph, “but Moses did not say the ox was to eat up <em>all</em>
the corn.” Brother Brigham made no reply, but is said to
have “sulked” for two or three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>I have often heard intelligent Gentiles remark, “Well, Brigham
Young may be a wicked man and an impostor, but there
<em>must</em> be a great deal of talent in him, to manage those people
for so many years.”</p>

<p>From this opinion I altogether dissent; and those who know
Brigham best, think with me, though many of them would not
dare to say so. I do not think Brigham Young a wicked
man or an impostor in the sense in which those words are
ordinarily used; but experience, and a careful study of his
life and doings, have convinced me that he is certainly not a
great man or a man of genius in <em>any</em> sense of the word.
There can be no doubt that he has been guilty of many and
great crimes, but I believe that in the early part of his career
he was so blinded by fanaticism that those crimes appeared to
him actually virtues:—the force of habit and the daily associations
of his life have so completely taken from him all sense of
right and wrong; while the devotion of his people has made
the idea that <em>he</em> could possibly do the slightest wrong so utterly
inconceivable to him and to them, that his perceptions of justice,
truth, honour, honesty, and upright dealing are as utterly
stultified as they ever were in the mind of the wildest savage
who prowled among the cliffs and cañons of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>People think that Brigham Young attained to his present
position by the exercise of ability, such as has been displayed,
only on a greater scale, by all those men who, not being born
to power, nor having it thrust upon them, have by the force of
their genius seized it and held it—unlawfully it might be, but,
nevertheless, with talent and moral energy.</p>

<p>Of the Prophet’s moral character, the less said the better.
He has been remorseless and cruel in his enmities, and he has
connived at and even suggested, if nothing more, some of the
most atrocious crimes that have ever been perpetrated on the
face of the earth. In business matters, in the payment of
money—to use a popular phrase—his word is as good as his
bond, but in the accumulation of wealth he has evinced an
amount of dishonesty which can scarcely be credited. Brigham
always meets his obligations, and pays his debts, and gets
a lawful receipt:—the prophetic business could not otherwise
be carried on; but the way in which he has obtained his
wealth would put to the blush the most dishonest member of
any “ring” in New York, or elsewhere. When he attended
his first Conference, he says he had to borrow certain masculine
garments and a pair of boots before he could put in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
appearance. Now it would be difficult to estimate the value
of his property. He has taken up large tracts of land all over
the Territory, he has the uncontrolled and unquestioned command
of all the tithing and contributions of the Saints, and
from gifts and confiscations, and innumerable other sources,
his revenue pours in. It was once rumoured that he had
eighteen or twenty millions of dollars in the Bank of England;
but Brigham said that the report was not true. “The Church,”
he added, had a little money invested abroad. The difference
between “The Church” and the individual Brigham Young
has yet to be determined.</p>

<p>In the year 1852 the “Prophet of the Lord” found that he
had borrowed an inconveniently large sum from the funds of
the Church. He is “Trustee in Trust” and, of course, legally
responsible; but he never renders an account of his stewardship,
and no one ever asks him for it. His sense of honesty
was, however, so strong that he resolved to have his account
balanced, and he went down to the Tithing-Office for that
purpose. There he found that his indebtedness amounted to
two hundred thousand dollars, and he proceeded to pay it after
his own fashion: the clerk was instructed to place to his
credit the same amount “<em>for services rendered</em>.” In 1867, he
owed <em>very nearly one million dollars</em>, which he had borrowed
from the same fund, and he balanced his account in the same
way. His contract for the Pacific Railroad is said to have
yielded him a quarter of a million, and his other contracts and
mining speculations, purchases <em>and thefts</em> of lands, houses, &amp;c.,
have been very profitable. The expenses of such a family as
Brother Brigham’s must be something enormous, but the contributions
which by honest and dishonest means he has levied
have been so large that he must still be one of the wealthiest
men in the States.</p>

<p>Brigham is not a generous man. He has given occasionally,
as for instance at the time of the Chicago fire, when he presented
a thousand dollars for the sufferers, but even then his
motive was evident—the affairs of “Deseret” were under discussion
in Congress. Without the certainty of a profitable
return, Brigham never gave a cent. The story of his sordid
avarice and his contemptible meanness in the accumulation of
money would fill a volume.</p>

<p>Morally and physically the Prophet is a great coward.
When he and other Church leaders were arrested a year or
two ago, charged with the very gravest crimes, the effect upon
the Prophet was most distressing. He had solemnly sworn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in the Tabernacle that he would shoot the man who attempted
to arrest him; but when Judge McKean opened court and
placed him under arrest, he swallowed his threats and played
the coward’s part. Before this the world has seen wretches
who were notorious for their cruelty and tyranny, and who
were also remarkable for their cowardice. For many years
he has imitated royalty and has had a strong body-guard to
keep watch and ward around his person every night. No
man has less cause to apprehend personal violence than
Brother Brigham, but the voice of conscience, which, as the
poet says, makes cowards of us all, suggests his fears.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WIVES OF BRIGHAM YOUNG:—THEIR HISTORY AND
THEIR DAILY LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The wives of Brigham Young have always been subjects of
interest to Gentiles who visited Zion; and having spoken of
their husband, I think it is only fair that I should say a few
words about them.</p>

<p>For many years I have known personally all the Prophet’s
wives who reside in Salt Lake City, and I wish to speak of
them with kindness and respect. They are women whom
any one would esteem—conscientious, good, earnest women;
faithful, true-hearted wives, who have devoted their lives to
the carrying out of what they believe is the revealed will of
God.</p>

<p>When I first knew Brother Brigham, poor man, he had <em>only</em>
sixteen living with him in Salt Lake City; and even now he
has no more than nineteen! Perhaps I ought to say eighteen,
since Eliza-Ann has run away from him, and left the poor old
gentleman desolate and forlorn. The three whom he took
after I came to Utah, were Amelia Folsom, Mary Van Cott
Cobb, and Eliza-Ann. But the reader will perhaps be interested
in hearing about them all, and so I will state the
names and order of the ladies as they at present stand—according
to the date of their marriage; making mention of the
proxy wives last of all, for the sake of convenience and without
reference to date. Of course Brother Brigham has <em>had</em>
many more than nineteen wives, but the following are the
living ladies; others are dead or have strayed away, no one
knew whither, and perhaps, as Brother Heber once said to me,
nobody cared.</p>

<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 168.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Allow me to introduce <em>the</em> Mrs. Young.</p>

<h3>MRS. MARY ANN ANGELL YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number One.]</span></h3>

<p>First in order is Mrs. Mary Ann Angell Young, but she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
not the first wife that Brother Brigham ever had. Once upon
a time, Brother Brigham was a Methodist; but after listening
to the preaching of the Mormon Missionaries he became a
vile apostate—as he loves to call those who leave his present
faith—and he forsook Methodism. In those days, before he
apostatised, and long before he ever dreamed of Polygamy, he
had but <em>one</em> wife—one only! It must seem strange to the
Prophet to look back to that period of solitary existence. His
second wife was Mrs. Angell Young; and I call her his first
wife because she is the first of those living now. As she was
married to him after the death of his first wife, she is, of
course, his legal wife, and would be recognized as such in
any civilized country. She is a very fine-looking old lady and
very much devoted to her unfaithful lord and master, firmly
believing in his divine mission. She lives by herself and is
seldom troubled with a visit from her affectionate spouse.
Once in a while Brigham brings her out to a party when he
has invited any Gentiles, just for appearance sake. Quite a
number of persons in Utah believe that she is dead, so very
little is seen and known of her. She lives in the White
House—Brigham’s first residence in Salt Lake City—and is
much thought of by those who do know her. Her children
are greatly attached to her, and show her a great deal of
attention, making up in this way, to a certain extent, for her
husband’s neglect; her three sons, Joseph A. Brigham—who
it is expected will succeed his father as President of the
Church—and John W., as well as her two daughters, Alice
and Luna, are all in Polygamy. Each of the sons has three
wives; and each of the daughters has a half-sister as a
partner in her husband’s affections. Brigham has not the
slightest objection to giving two of his daughters to the same
husband.</p>

<h3>LUCY DECKER SEELY YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Two.]</span></h3>

<p>Lucy Decker Seely Young was his first wife in Polygamy.
Her former husband was a Mr. Seely. She is short and stout,
a very excellent mother and a devoted wife.</p>

<h3>CLARA DECKER YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Three.]</span></h3>

<p>Clara Decker Young is the third wife. She is a sister of
Lucy Seely, and like her is short and stout, but otherwise
good-looking. She is more than twenty years younger than
her lord, with whom she was once quite a favourite, but like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
many others, she has “had her day”—to use Brigham’s own
expression—and is now, as a matter of course, neglected.</p>

<h3>HARRIET COOK YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Four.]</span></h3>

<p>Harriet Cook Young is tall, with light hair and blue eyes,
and is an intelligent but not at all a refined woman. She is
said to have given a great deal of trouble to Brother Brigham,
of whom she has frequently said very hard things. In times
past she had the reputation of being a good deal more than a
match for her husband when she had any cause of offence
against him, but in her quiet moments she is a very sincere
Mormon. She has only one son—Oscar Young—now about
twenty-five years of age. When he was born, Brigham kindly
announced to her that because she was not obedient she
should have no more children, and during more than a quarter
of a century he has kept his word. Why she has remained
with him so long is a mystery, for she makes no secret of her
feelings towards him.</p>

<h3>LUCY BIGELOW YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Five.]</span></h3>

<p>Lucy Bigelow Young is quite a fine-looking woman—tall
and fair, and still quite young. She has three pretty daughters.
Brigham has recently sent her to live in southern Utah.</p>

<h3>MRS. TWISS YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Six.]</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Twiss Young has no children, but she is a very good
housewife, and Brigham appreciates her accordingly, and has
given her the position of housekeeper in the Lion House.
Women have two great privileges in the Mormon Church—they
may ask a man to marry them, if they chance to fancy
him, and if they don’t like him afterwards they are able to
obtain a divorce for the moderate sum of ten dollars, which
sum the husband is expected to pay. Mrs. Twiss exercised
the first privilege in reference to Brother Brigham, but has
not yet availed herself of the last. There are other ladies who
thought it would be a great honour to be called the wives of
the Prophet, and they have requested him to allow them to be
called by his name. This he has done, but he has never
troubled them with his society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h3>MARTHA BOWKER YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Seven.]</span></h3>

<p>Martha Bowker Young is a quiet little body, with piercing
dark eyes, and very retiring. Brother Brigham acts towards
her as if he had quite forgotten that he had ever married
her, and she lives in all the loneliness of married spinsterhood.</p>

<h3>HARRIET BARNEY SEAGERS YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Eight.]</span></h3>

<p>Harriet Barney Seagers Young, the eighth wife, is a tall,
fine-looking woman. She was another man’s wife when
Brigham made love to her. It is not supposed to be the correct
thing for a Saint to court his neighbour’s wife, but the Prophet
did so in the case of Harriet Barney, and in several other
cases too. Harriet was married to a respectable young Mormon
gentleman, but after she had lived with him some time
and had borne three children to him, the Prophet persuaded
her to join his ranks, and she did so, believing that the word
of the Prophet was the revelation of the Lord to her, but she
has since had bitter cause to repent of her folly. To a Gentile
mind such an infatuation must appear very strange, but the
Mormon people personally understand the powerful influence
which their religion exercises over them, and to them there is
nothing very singular in all this.</p>

<h3>ELIZA BURGESS YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Nine.]</span></h3>

<p>Eliza Burgess Young is the only English wife that Brigham
has. She fell in love with the Prophet, wanted him to marry
her, and even offered to wait, like Jacob, for seven years if she
might be his at last. So she served in the family of her lord
for the appointed time, and he finally took her to wife as a
recompense for her faithfulness. She has added one son to
the Prophet’s kingdom.</p>

<h3>SUSAN SNIVELY YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Ten.]</span></h3>

<p>The tenth wife on my list is Susan Snively Young. She is
a German woman—smart, active, and industrious. She has
no children, but has been quite a help-meet to her husband in
making butter and cheese, in which she excels. Smart Mormons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
have always had an eye to business, and while living up
to their privileges have not invariably sought for wives who
were only fair and pleasant to look upon, but have frequently
taken them for their own intrinsic worth: one as a good
dairymaid, another as a good cook, a third as a good laundress,
and a fourth as a lady to grace the parlour—perhaps
even two or three of this last kind, if the Saint were wealthy.
There is a good deal of practical wisdom in this. Brother
Brigham has gathered of all sorts into his net, and has then
sorted them out, placing each lady in the position where he
considered she would be most useful and profitable to
himself.</p>

<h3>MARGARET PIERCE YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Eleven.]</span></h3>

<p>Margaret Pierce Young is very lady-like, tall, and genteel.
She has the appearance of being very unhappy, and it is
certain that she has been very much neglected, but not more
so than many of the other wives. She has one son.</p>

<h3>EMMELINE FREE YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Twelve.]</span></h3>

<p>When first I went to Utah, Emmeline Free Young was the
reigning favourite, and she was really the handsomest of
Brigham’s wives—tall and graceful, with curling hair, beautiful
eyes, and fair complexion. Brigham was as fond of her, at
the time, as a man of his nature, with such a low estimate of
woman, could be. But a younger, though not a handsomer,
rival soon captivated his fickle heart, and he left poor Emmeline
to mourn in sorrow. She has never been herself since then,
and probably never will be—she is a broken-hearted woman.
She is the mother of quite a numerous family, and doubtless,
as she had been the favourite for so long a time, she had come
to believe that her husband would never seek another love.
But, if this was so, she sadly miscalculated Brigham, for when
his licentious fancy was attracted to another object of affection
he cast off Emmeline as ruthlessly as he would an old garment.
What decent person could refrain from loathing such a man!
How often has my heart gone out in sympathy towards that
poor, wrecked woman whom he had forsaken; what a pity
I deemed it that so much love should be wasted upon a creature
who could never understand or appreciate it. And yet
Emmeline’s fate has been no worse than that of the others;
but I was more with her, and saw how keenly she suffered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and I sympathized with her when her sorrows brought her
nearly to the point of death.</p>

<h3>AMELIA FOLSOM YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Thirteen.]</span></h3>

<p>Amelia Folsom Young is now the favourite, and it is supposed
that she will continue to be so, for at last poor Brother
Brigham has found a woman of whom he stands in dread. It
is doubtful whether he loves her, but nobody in Zion doubts
that he fears her. It is said that the Prophet has confided so
many of his secrets to Amelia that he is obliged to submit
to her tyranny, for fear of her leaving him, and exposing some
of his little ways which would not bear the light. Be that
as it may, it is generally believed that after all his matrimonial
alliances he has at last found his <em>master</em> in the person of
Amelia. Even good Saints—friends of the Prophet—secretly
enjoy the idea of him being at last brought under petticoat
government, for it is believed that Brigham used unfair means
to obtain her, and that at last he only gained his object by
deluding her into the belief that the Lord had revealed to him
that it was her duty to become his wife. One thing is very
certain—he was as crazy over her as a silly boy over his first
love, much to the disgust of his more sober brethren, who felt
rather ashamed of the folly of their leader. At the theatre a
seat was reserved for her at his side, and in the ball-room the
same special attention was shown to her. He would open the
ball, and, after dancing with each of his other wives who
might be present—simply for appearance sake—the remainder
of the evening was devoted to her. For all that, his inconstant
heart could not remain faithful to her, and old habits and
feelings, to all appearance, have come over him again, and he
has gone astray.</p>

<p>Julia Dean, the actress, was the first to draw him from
Amelia’s side, and it would have been a sorry day for Amelia
if Julia had favoured the Prophet’s suit. Then the charms of
Mary Van Cott touched his sensitive heart, to say nothing of
Eliza-Ann, his last but yet not his best-beloved.</p>

<p>With all this experience, and the constant evidences of the
fickleness of Brother Brigham’s heart before her eyes, there is
no wonder that poor Amelia feels compelled to hold tight the
reins, now that they are in her own hands, for, if it is not
much to be known as Brigham’s wife, it is a great deal to be
known as his favourite. As for the future, it is whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that Brother Brigham has lately been “setting his house in
order,” and in the ordinary course of nature, Amelia is almost
certain to outlive for many years her aged lord, she, therefore,
can afford to wait for the good time coming. But Amelia
knows that she would sink into oblivion if he were to cast her
off for another before his death.</p>

<h3>MARY VAN COTT COBB YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Fourteen.]</span></h3>

<p>Mary Van Cott Cobb—who became Brigham’s wife after his
marriage to Amelia—is a very handsome woman, about
twenty-eight years of age. She is tall, slender, and graceful,
and has been married to the Prophet about six years. At
first he appeared to be very devoted to her, but Amelia soon
put a stop to that. Nevertheless, she has since her marriage
presented a little daughter to her lord, greatly to the annoyance
of Amelia, who has no children. She is said to be very
unhappy, and though Brigham has provided her with a fine
house and every comfort, yet she seldom sees him—not perhaps
more than once in three months, or so—though it is generally
believed that his spirit is willing, but Amelia won’t allow
it.</p>

<h3>ELIZA-ANN WEBB DEE YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Fifteen.]</span></h3>

<p>Eliza-Ann Webb Dee Young, commonly known as his “runaway
wife,” is his last wedded and nineteenth living wife. If
his deceased wives were taken into consideration she would probably
be his thirtieth. In this list I have put all the living
wives who are sealed to Brigham for eternity first, and thus I
count Eliza-Ann fifteen, but had I placed the proxy wives—who
are only Brigham’s “for time,” in the list, she would, of
course, be the “nineteenth,” as she is generally called.</p>

<h3>“MISS” ELIZA R. SNOW.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Sixteen.]</span></h3>

<p>“Miss” Eliza R. Snow I mention here as I have not followed
the order of date. She and the three ladies whose
names I shall presently give, are the proxy wives of Brigham,
living with him.</p>

<h3>ZINA D. HUNTINGTON JACOBS YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Seventeen.]</span></h3>

<p>Zina D. Huntington Jacobs Young is another proxy wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and a widow of the Prophet Joseph. She, too, will have to be
handed over in the day of reckoning. She has one grown up
daughter, of whom I shall presently speak under rather interesting
circumstances.</p>

<h3>EMILY PARTRIDGE YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Eighteen.]</span></h3>

<p>Emily Partridge Young is a tall, dark-eyed, handsome
woman, and she also is a “proxy” wife—a relict of Joseph.
When Joseph died, Brigham told his wives that they were at
liberty to choose whom they would for husbands; and some
of them showed their appreciation of his generosity by choosing
him himself. Thus it was that Emily Partridge became
Brigham’s wife. The Prophet has dealt kindly to his brother
Joseph Smith, through her, for she has quite a family of
children to be handed over with her. She was young and
handsome when the Prophet died, but perhaps it would be
wrong to suppose that that had anything to do with Brigham’s
generosity to his brother, for it is generally believed that he
took all those wives of Joseph, from pure principle.</p>

<h3>AUGUSTA COBB YOUNG.<br />
<span class="smaller">[Number Nineteen.]</span></h3>

<p>Augusta Cobb Young is a very fine-looking woman, and
must have been quite handsome in her youthful days. As I
before stated, she formerly lived in Boston, but hearing Brigham
preach, she fell in love with him, abandoned her home,
children, and husband, and, taking her youngest child with
her, went to Salt Lake City, and was married to the Prophet.
It was she who, when Brigham began to neglect her, wanted
to be sealed to Christ, but was ultimately added to the kingdom
of Joseph Smith.</p>

<p>Now these are the Prophet’s wives—his real, living wives—nineteen
in all. How many spiritual wives he has had it
would be impossible to say. Probably he himself does not
know their number.</p>

<p>In his habits and mode of living, Brigham Young is very
simple, or at least was so until recently. When I first knew
him he dressed in plain, home-spun, home-made, and every
article about his person and his houses was as plain and
unostentatious as could possibly be. But the importation of
Gentiles and Gentile goods, since the opening of the railway,
has worked a great change. His wives, who once carried simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of dress almost to the verge of dowdyism, have now
acquired a taste for Eastern fashions.</p>

<p>The Prophet’s first home in Utah was a little cottage which
is now known as the White House.—The same house, I
believe, which was valued at sixty thousand dollars, and which
Brother Tenant supposed he bought:—a more scandalous and
barefaced robbery never was perpetrated.</p>

<p>This is on the hill-side, north of the Eagle Gate, and is now
the residence of his first wife, Mrs. Angell Young. The Bee-Hive
House is the official residence of Brother Brigham.
There he used to reign supreme as “Governor” Young; and
thence he now issues secular and ecclesiastical edicts to all who
acknowledge his sway. There is one lady resident in this
house—Mrs. Lucy Decker Young—and no one else is permitted
to intrude upon its privacy. Here the prophet has his
own private bedroom, and here he breakfasts when he has
been at home over night.</p>

<p>The Lion House is what ought to be the home of the
Prophet, for here nearly all his wives reside. (He has, however,
many other houses in the city.) On the basement floor is the
dining-room, kitchen, pantry, and other general offices. The
first floor is divided by a long passage with doors on each side.
On the right hand, about half-a-dozen wives with small families
find accommodation. On the left, at the entrance, is the
parlour, and the other rooms on that side are occupied by
mothers with larger families, and ladies who have a little more
than ordinary attention. The upper floor is divided into twenty
square bedrooms.</p>

<p>There is no extravagance in the furniture or apparel of these
wives, but they are comfortable and are kept neat and clean.
Again and again, the Prophet has declared that the ten-dollar
fees which are obtained from the divorces provide his wives
with pin-money. I do not believe a word of this, as the
amount thus obtained is far more than the avaricious soul of
the Prophet would allow to pass out of his hands for feminine
vanities. But I know of another source of income which is
open to the wives. They are allowed all the fruit—peaches
especially—which they or their children, can gather or dry.
This, in fact, is pretty nearly their only “pin-money” their
“lord” is not a generous man, and they have to make the most
of trifles.</p>

<p>The Prophet usually dines in the Lion House at three in
the afternoon. Mrs. Twiss Young, as I mentioned before,
acts the part of housekeeper, and she acts it well. At three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
punctually the bell rings, and the mothers with their children
move down to the dining-room. They are all seated at a very
long table which is lengthened by turning round at the end of
the room. Each mother has her children around her. Brigham
sits at the head of the table, with his favourite—when at
home—<i lang="fr">vis à vis</i>, or on his left, and if a visitor is present he
sits at the Prophet’s right hand. The repast is frugal but
ample, for Brigham is a sober and exceedingly economical
man. This is the first time he sees his family. In the evening
at seven o’clock the bell again rings, and the mothers and
the children again fill the sides and end of the parlour. When
they are all seated, the patriarch enters, takes his seat at the
table and chats quietly with those who chance to go in with
him to prayers. When all the members of the family are
assembled, the door is closed. All kneel down and the
Prophet prays, invoking special blessings upon Zion and “the
kingdom.” This is the last that his family see of him for the
day, unless they have occasion to seek him privately.</p>

<p>With his family Brother Brigham is said to be kind; but it
is supposed to be more the awe which his position as Prophet
inspires, than the love which they bear him as a man which
renders him successful in managing them. At the same time,
that sweet familiarity is destroyed which should exist between
husband and wife, father and children. With such a number
of wives, he cannot possibly wait upon them in visiting, and
in the ball-room, and other places of amusement. With the
exception of his reigning favourite, whoever for the time she
may happen to be, no one expects his attentions. At the
theatre a full number of seats are reserved, and his wives
attend, or remain at home, as they please. They sit in the
body of the parquette, among the rest of the people; but one
of the two proscenium boxes is reserved for him, and beside
him is a chair for the favourite Amelia.</p>

<p>When he goes to the ball, the same special attention is shown.
He dances first with the favourite, and, if half-a-dozen more
of his wives have accompanied them, he will dance with each
of them once in the course of the evening; but with the
favourite he dances as frequently as any youth in the ball-room
with his first maiden love. The Apostles and leading men of
the community, who dance attendance on him and desire his
favour, are sure to seek the pleasure of her hand and place her
in the same cotillion with Brigham, who is thus able all the
evening to enjoy her company.</p>

<p>Some of the Apostles and Elders look with pain upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
boyishness of the Prophet, and deplore it. Many of them are
attached to their first wives, and have shown them consideration
and attention which has not always pleased Brother
Brigham. I have heard more than one of them, express a wish
that the Prophet had been a little more attentive to his own
first wife.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">WAYS AND WORKS OF THE SAINTS:—THE PROPHET’S
MILLINERY BILL.</span></h2>

<p>When I arrived in Utah I found that nearly all the Elders
with whom I had formerly been acquainted had more than
one wife there. Many of these brethren called to see me,
and kindly insisted that I should visit their families; but this
I felt was almost an impossibility.</p>

<p>My whole nature rebelled at the thought of visiting where
there were several wives; for, in defiance of all the teaching
that I had listened to, and the tyranny to which we had submitted,
human nature would assert itself, and my womanly
instincts revolted against the system. I could not endure the
thought of visiting those families in company with my husband.
I thought that perhaps sometimes I might venture <em>alone</em>; but,
oh, not with him,—no, not with him. It was bad enough and
humiliating enough for me to witness by myself the degradation
of my sex; but to do so in the presence of my husband
was more than I could calmly contemplate. I knew that I
should not be able to control myself, and might probably say
some very unpleasant things, which I should afterwards regret;
for I so thoroughly loathed even the idea of polygamy at that
time that I was filled with a desire to let every one know and
understand just what my feelings were on that subject.</p>

<p>I had left New York against my will, although I had not
openly rebelled. I had never reproached my husband about
it, for I felt that his lot was irrevocably cast with the Mormons:
I knew that when I married him, and it was of no use now
for me to repine. I must go on to the end—there was no help
for me. The journey across the Plains, and all the discoveries
which I had made, had not tended to soothe my rebellious
heart, and I am not quite sure that I did not sow by the way
a little discontent among the sisters. The idea, however, that
such was the case did not, I must admit, fill me with much
repentance. To my husband I had said very little, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
think he would bear me witness that what I did say was said
effectively. Now when I was brought face to face with practical
polygamy and could observe it in its most repulsive phases, I
hated it more than ever.</p>

<p>One day not long after our arrival, as we were taking a walk
together, I saw across the road a man gesticulating after an
eccentric fashion and beckoning to us. Mr. Stenhouse said,
“That is Brother Heber C. Kimball;” and I looked again with
interest to see what that celebrated Apostle was like. I had
both heard and read a great deal about Brother Heber, and
what I had learned was not at all of a character to impress
me favourably—he had been so severe in his denunciation of
every woman who dared to oppose polygamy. On the present
occasion his conduct was, I thought, anything but gentlemanly;
and when we crossed the road to him,—which on account of
his position in the Church—next to Brigham himself—we, of
course, were compelled to do,—my face must have betrayed
my feelings I am sure, for almost his first words after shaking
hands were, “Have you got the blues?”</p>

<p>My answer was ready in a moment. “I have had nothing
else ever since I came here.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “it is time that you should get rid of
them, and I am going to talk to you some day soon, for I rather
like your looks.”</p>

<p>I did not like <em>his</em> looks much, however, nor was I at all
pleased with his manner. I do not say that I was altogether
without blame in feeling thus, for I was prejudiced. Of course
I was prejudiced. From the first moment when I heard that
polygamy was a doctrine of the Church, I was predisposed to
be dissatisfied with everything: I was henceforth not myself,
for the terrible apprehension of my own fate in the “Celestial
Order” had changed my whole nature, and that change of
itself was a great source of grief to me. I keenly realized
that I was no longer the light-hearted, pleasant companion to
my husband that I had been, and many a time and oft I wished
for his sake that I could die, for I felt that I never could be
happy in Mormonism again.</p>

<p>How many times have I knelt by my husband’s couch when
he was unconscious of it, and have wept bitter tears of sorrow,
earnestly praying to the Lord to subdue my rebellious heart,
and, if it were necessary, rather than I should be a continual
annoyance to my husband, whom I loved with all my soul, that
every particle of love in my heart should be withered, so that
I might perchance, if without love, be able at least to do my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
duty. I fully realized that in polygamy there could be no real
love; and while my affections were still placed upon my husband,
it was torture to live in a community where I was
compelled to listen to the “counsels” which were given to
him, day after day, regardless of my presence, to take another
wife. I was too proud to notice any ordinary allusion that
was made to the subject before me; but when the conversation
was turned in that direction by those who professed to be sincere
friends and to entertain a kindly interest in my welfare,
I was compelled to listen and reply.</p>

<p>In my unhappy condition, I thought that perhaps I might
derive some consolation from the sermons in the Tabernacle—something
that might shed a softer light upon my rugged
pathway. But instead of obtaining consolation, I heard that
which aroused every feeling of my soul to rebellion, and
kindled again within me the indignation which I had been so
long struggling to conquer. I heard that woman was an inferior
being, designed by the Lord for the special glory and
exaltation of man, that she was a creature that should feel
herself honoured if he would only make her the mother of his
children—a creature who if very obedient and faithful through
all the trials and tribulations in life, might some day be
rewarded by becoming one of her husband’s queens, but
should even then shine only by virtue of the reflected light
derived from the glory of her spouse and lord. He was to be
her “saviour,” for he was all in all to her; and it was through
him alone and at his will that she could obtain salvation. We
were informed that man was the crowning glory of creation,
for whom all things—woman included—were brought into
being; and that the chief object of woman’s existence was to
help man to his great destiny.</p>

<p>Not a sentence—indeed, not a word—did we ever hear as to
the possibility of womanly perfection and exaltation in her
own right; and not only so, but, as if this were not enough to
crush all ambition out of our souls, we were instructed in some
new views of marriage. The great object of marriage, we
were told, was the increase of children. Those diviner objects—the
companionship of soul, the devotion of a refined and
pure affection, the indissoluble union of two existences—were
never presented to the yearning hearts of those poor
women who listened to the miserable harangues of the Tabernacle:
such aspirations had nothing to do with the hard,
cruel facts of their life in polygamy.</p>

<p>And this I found was how the women of Utah were spiritually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
sustained. Seldom, indeed, was taught anything better,
but frequently much that was worse. If Nature, asserting its
right to a full return of love, should manifest itself, and inspire
some of these poor wives to rebel against the lives which they
were compelled to lead in polygamy, then it would be said, in
the language of the Tabernacle, that the women were “filled
with the devil,” and that unless they repented speedily, they
would “apostatize and go to hell;”—an assurance which was
scarcely necessary, for many of those poor souls were enduring
as much as if they were there already. Or if some woman
was found objecting to polygamy on account of its crushing
and degrading effects upon women generally, then, as I just
said, she was told in the coarse language of Brigham Young
himself, that “such women had no business to complain; it
was quite enough honour for them to be permitted to bear
children to God’s holy Priesthood.”</p>

<p>I found, therefore; that the sermons in the Tabernacle were
not calculated to help me much spiritually. I had neither
friend nor counsellor on earth to whom I could turn for help—my
God alone remained to me. But, ah, how different were
my ideas of God then, from those which I entertained before
and since. Once I could look upon the beauties of nature
and the varied experiences of human life, and while my soul
was lifted up with devotion and gratitude, I could see the
loving hand of my Heavenly Father in everything around me.
Now there was neither light nor beauty before my eyes—all
was dark and dreary; there was nothing to draw away my
heart from such sad thoughts as these. It was painfully clear
to my understanding, then as now, that in Mormonism woman
was to lose her personal identity. All that Christianity had
done to elevate her was to be ruthlessly set aside and trampled
under foot, and she was instantly to return to the position
which she occupied in the darkest ages of the world’s
existence.</p>

<p>I had at that time the daily and hourly cares of a family
devolving upon me, and had not therefore much leisure to
spend in visiting my friends even if I had desired to do so.
Notwithstanding that, however, I had abundant opportunities
of observation; and thus my experience of Mormonism and
polygamy in Utah is much the same as that of any Mormon
woman of ordinary sense; I only tell what others could relate
if they had the inclination to do so. It was not possible for
me to live in Salt Lake City without being brought face to face
with polygamy in some shape or other every day of my life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Had it been otherwise, and if remaining at home would have
kept it from my view, I probably never should have had the
courage to enter a house where it was practised. To those
who know nothing of that degrading system this may seem
rather an exaggeration of feeling; and yet, even at that early
day, I had seen so much of the folly and weakness of the
Mormon brethren, both in London and New York, before we
went to Utah, and had witnessed so many evil results of their
teachings, that it was with the greatest difficulty that I could
control my feelings sufficiently to call upon any family where
there was more than one wife. And yet what I knew then
was nothing in comparison to what I afterwards witnessed—yes,
that I myself endured.</p>

<p>During the winter, although I visited very little, I attended
a good many parties at the Social Hall; but I did so more
from a wish to be agreeable to my husband than from any
pleasure that they afforded me, for life had long since been losing
almost all its charms for me. How many times have I gazed
wistfully at those lofty mountains which surrounded the city,
and felt that they were indeed my prison walls. How bitterly
have I realized that I should never be able to go beyond them.
But in a new country, with a family to provide for, a mother
has not much time to waste in pining, even if it be for liberty
itself, and I would willingly draw the veil over that portion of
my life.</p>

<p>As my husband had been on mission for so many years and
had spent all his time in the service of the Church, with the
exception of a few brief months before we left New York—when
he was engaged on the staff of the New York <cite>Herald</cite>—I
naturally enough thought that when we reached Zion his
occupation would be gone. There would be no need of
preaching to the Saints: on the contrary they would be able
to teach us; and we should have to find out what we could do
in this new country to support ourselves and our children. In
this I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Now among the “absolutely necessary” things which I had
brought with me from New York, were about three hundred
dollars’ worth of millinery goods, which I had secreted among
our other properties, thinking that they would very probably
come in useful to the fair daughters of Zion—notwithstanding
that the Elders had told me of fiery sermons, delivered by
the Prophet himself, condemning all feminine display, and that
the sisters would scorn to wear Gentile fashions. I knew my
own sex too well to believe that all this was strictly true, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
I felt certain that I should find, even among the Saints, some
weak sisters who would appreciate my thoughtfulness in
bringing such articles for their use. I had also noticed that
the American Elders themselves would frequently inquire
where they could buy the best gloves and the prettiest ribbons
and laces, and that looked a little suspicious.</p>

<p>Quite a number of such articles, therefore, found their way
into my list of “absolute necessaries,” and I know that my
husband was secretly quite at a loss to know what had become
of a certain sum of money which he was aware I had obtained
from the sale of some of our things in New York.
But my foresight in this instance was very useful to us when
we arrived in Zion.</p>

<p>One day when Mr. Stenhouse was absent seeking employment,
I thought I would make a display of my treasures and
surprise him on his return. Accordingly, with the assistance
of our faithful domestic, whom I had brought with me across
the Plains, and who had also lived with me in Switzerland,
we contrived to place two or three planks in such a way as
to make a rough table on which to display the goods. I
had been secretly at work for about two weeks, trimming the
bonnets and hats, and making a number of head-dresses, such
as were worn in New York when we left; and, although
we had been three months on the Plains, and quite a month
in Utah, yet those bonnets and head-dresses were of the very
latest style to the ladies of Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>My Swiss girl was quite a carpenter, and when my temporary
table was arranged, I placed a pretty-looking cloth over
it to hide its defects, and then began to arrange the various
articles. I found that I had a much finer assortment than I
had imagined, for I had bought them at different times, and
had packed them away hurriedly, lest Mr. Stenhouse or some
of the other Elders—for there were generally one or two in
the house—should object to my taking them. When my
table was filled, and I found that I had still more to display, I
was very much pleased, for I saw in my hats and bonnets,
flour, meat, and potatoes for my children, and I felt hopeful,
for one of the sisters had assured me that I should be certain
to sell them. The next thing to do was to advertise my stock.
After some reflection, I remembered another of the sisters,
who was quite a good talker, and who felt very kindly towards
me. I had known her in England—she had been in Utah
about three years, and her husband had by that time been
blessed with two other wives. She used to say that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
no patience with a set of grumbling women, who did not
know what was good for them. I do not think that the
blessedness enjoyed by her husband was shared by the
two wives, for more forlorn-looking women I never saw.
My husband, however, told me that this was none of my
business, and I believed him, of course, after the fashion of all
good wives.</p>

<p>But to return. This good sister, besides being an excellent
talker, had really nothing else to do except visiting her neighbours,
for the other wives now took entire charge of all the
household duties. So I made her a present of a new bonnet,
as I knew that then in two days my goods would be quite
sufficiently advertised; and in this I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Almost the first visitors who called to see me were a lady
and her daughter. I talked freely to her and answered her
inquiries, and she told me that she herself had had some
experience in the business. “In Salt Lake City,” she said,
“I think you will not be able to sell those goods; they are too
fashionable for the people here, and there is no encouragement
given to any one in this business. I am afraid you will be
disappointed.”</p>

<p>I believed every word she said, and felt all my airy, hopeful
castles begin to crumble away. Before she left, however, she
very kindly offered to purchase all my goods at a low figure
and thus relieve me of the anxiety and trouble of selling them.
But I had had a little experience in the world,—although
probably I appeared to her somewhat innocent,—and I thought
that if she could sell them, there was a chance at least that I
also might be able to do so. At any rate, I resolved to try,
and I told her so, when she left me with many kind wishes for
my success. But what she had said during her visit had
chilled my enthusiasm, and I pictured all my pretty newly-made
articles becoming soiled and faded, with no one to buy
them; while the little ones, barefooted—like so many children
in Utah then—were running about crying for bread which I
could not buy them. I felt sad, and, if I must confess it, I sat
down and had a good cry.</p>

<p>Just at that moment I heard a knock at the door, and
hastily drying my eyes, I opened it, and there stood my talkative
friend.</p>

<p>“Stop crying!” she exclaimed. “What is the matter, my
dear? Oh <em>do</em> stop crying. I don’t like crying women: we
see so many of them among the Saints of God that it is really a
shame and a disgrace. Tell me what is the matter? Has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
your husband got another wife? or are you afraid he won’t be
able to get one? Come, tell me!”</p>

<p>All this was uttered in a breath, and without the possibility
of my putting in a word by way of reply or remonstrance. At
last I told her that I had just had a visit from one of the
sisters and her daughter, whom I described.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said; “I met her as I was coming here. Do
you know who she is?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “I do not think she told me her name;
she simply came to look at the goods.”</p>

<p>“And did she tell you that they would sell well, and
that they are the best investment that you could have
made?”</p>

<p>“Quite the contrary,” I said, “she discouraged me so much
that I could not help shedding tears.”</p>

<p>“Well now,” she answered, “that was Mrs. C——, one of
our milliners here; and you suppose she was going to encourage
you to set up an opposition shop, do you? If you do,
why, you’ve got something yet to learn.” Indeed I felt that I
had got a great deal to learn.</p>

<p>“Now I have come to tell you quite a different story,” she
said. “This very afternoon you will have at least a dozen ladies
here; and ladies, too, who have got the money to pay for what
they have, and who won’t pay you in salt chips and whetstones.”</p>

<p>“Do they ever pay in such things?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Why certainly they do. That is the kind of pay that the
good Saints generally expect their poor brethren and sisters
to be satisfied with, and to feed their hungry children upon.
But I say that this is wrong. Not that I want to set myself
up as a judge in Zion, or that I should criticize the actions of
the brethren, God forbid! But when I see the rich brethren
grinding the faces of the poor in that way, why, I say that it is
wrong. But you must not take any such pay as that. You
may not always get money, but you can at least get flour,
potatoes, and molasses. Now, I tell you that you are going to
sell every article that you have got, and I shall take pleasure
in recommending you and talking about it. Why, I’ve been to
about two score people already; but, there! I see your husband
coming, and I must go!” My husband, indeed, <em>was</em>
there. He was not very fond of my talkative friend, and
passed her by with a polite salutation only; but when he saw
what I had been doing, the light dawned upon his mind, he
no longer wondered what had become of the dollars in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
York, and, astonished at my success, he congratulated me
upon the good use to which I had put them.</p>

<p>After this interview I felt quite encouraged, and I very soon
found that my friend’s predictions were correct. I had no
difficulty in selling, and I created quite a little business,
although we lived a considerable distance from Main Street.
And what with my efforts, and some employment which my
husband obtained, we contrived to get through our first winter
in Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>But I anticipate.</p>

<p>One day my husband informed me that there was a house
about to be vacated shortly, and that Brigham Young had told
him we had better take it. It was pleasantly situated near
the Tabernacle, and, as houses then were, it was quite a
desirable residence. We had it thoroughly cleaned, and then
moved in. When I arrived in the evening I found that Mr.
Stenhouse, with the assistance of our faithful Swiss girl, had
arranged everything as the goods arrived from the other
house; and the place looked so clean, and there was such a
bright fire burning that I felt that we now had really something
like a home, and my heart was filled with gratitude.</p>

<p>Soon after our establishment in our new home, Brigham sent
for me and asked me to make a handsome bonnet for his then
favourite wife Emmeline. He left it entirely to my taste; I was
to make just what I pleased, so that it suited her and gave
satisfaction.</p>

<p>I made my bonnet; and when I presented it, Brigham
Young was so pleased that he immediately gave me an order
to make one for each of his wives. I was very much pleased at
this, for we needed furniture and many other necessaries very
badly, and I thought that this would enable me to get them. I
expected, of course, that my account would be paid in money,
for I did not suppose that the Prophet of the Lord would offer
me chips or whetstones: he could afford to pay cash, and,
of course, would do so. He had furnished me with some
material out of his own store—for Brigham Young had a dry-goods
and grocery store of his own at that time—and I was
to furnish the remainder. It was very little indeed that he
supplied, and therefore my account was likely to amount to a
considerable sum, for almost every wife had at least one bonnet
which she wished made over with new trimmings, besides the
new one.</p>

<p>I worked constantly for three weeks, with the assistance of
two girls, to each of whom I paid six dollars a week besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
board. This was a difficult thing for me to do at that time in
Utah, for money was seldom seen there then; but I was
rejoicing in the prospect of the comfortable new furniture
which I should have when it was all done. Furniture at that
time was very expensive; there was nothing better than white
pine articles, stained or painted. The commonest kind of
wooden rocking-chair cost fifteen dollars, and common painted
wooden chairs were six dollars a piece, with everything else in
proportion. This being our first winter, we had not been able
to get much, and I thought I would devote the proceeds of
the work I was doing for Brigham to fitting up the house a
little; and, with what I earned from my other customers, I
contrived to pay my help, so as to have all the rest clear.</p>

<p>All was completed, and great satisfaction expressed at the
result of my labours. So I asked my husband to present my
account and, if possible, get it settled; it amounted to about
275 dollars, although I had dealt very liberally with the
Prophet, and had charged for the goods but little more than
they cost me. When he returned, I hastened to meet him, for
I had partly selected the furniture and I wanted to go and
purchase it. But I was like poor Perrette, the milkmaid, who
counted her chickens a little too soon; for Mr. Stenhouse told
me that Brother Brigham had given orders that the amount
should be credited to us <em>for tithing</em>! What a shock this was
to me; for that sum, small as it may appear, was my whole
fortune at the time, and it was gone at one sweep! “Can it
be possible,” I said, “that he can be so mean as that?
Where can his conscience be? or has he any; to deprive me of
my hard earnings in this way? He shall not do it—I will
<em>make</em> him pay me.”</p>

<p>My indignation was so great that I did not reflect how
imprudent I was to talk thus of the Prophet of the Lord; but
my husband said, “What can you <em>do</em>? You cannot help
yourself. You can <em>do</em> nothing but submit. Let us try to forget
it; or, if not, it will perhaps be a lesson to us.” But I
did not forget it and never could, although I tried very hard;
and when many months had passed, and I no longer suffered
from the effects of my loss, I still remembered it, and I always
<em>shall</em> remember the way in which Brigham paid for his wives’
bonnets.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">MYSTERIES OF THE ENDOWMENT HOUSE—FEARFUL OATHS
AND SECRET CEREMONIES.</span></h2>

<p>Not many weeks after our arrival in Salt Lake City, my
husband told me that we might now enjoy the privilege of
going through the Endowment House.</p>

<p>This was intended as a great favour to us, on the part of the
authorities, for most people have to wait a long while before
receiving their Endowments; but my husband’s influence and
position in the Church was, I presume, the reason why we
were admitted so soon.</p>

<p>Now, I had heard so much of the Endowments and the
Endowment House that I quite dreaded to pass through this
ordeal. The idea of the whole ceremony was, that thereby we
should receive the special grace of God; be united, man and
woman, making one perfect creature; receive our inheritance
as children of God; and, in fact, be made partakers of the
plenitude of every blessing.</p>

<p>I knew well that no marriage was considered binding unless
it had been celebrated in that place. I knew that the Saints,
however long they might have been wedded, were under the
necessity of being reunited there before they could be considered
lawfully married and their children legitimate. According
to the highest Mormon authority, no marriage is valid
unless the ceremony is performed in the Temple. The Temple
is not yet built, and as Joseph, the Prophet, said, “No fellow
can be damned for doing the best he knows how,” the Saints,
meanwhile, do “the next best thing,” and are married in the
Endowment House. I knew that there and then the faithful
were said to be “endowed” with their heavenly inheritance.
I saw how <em>absolutely needful</em> it was that my husband and myself
should become partakers of those mysteries; but I was
influenced by the strange stories which I had heard of
unhallowed and shameful doings in that same Endowment
House, and consequently I feared to enter in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>My fears were not, however, altogether groundless or
visionary. It has been whispered—falsely perhaps—that in
that Endowment House scenes have been enacted so fearful
that words would falter on the lips of those who told the tale
concerning them. I have <em>heard</em> of such things from men of
integrity and honour; but they were not eye-witnesses of
what they related, and they could not, or would not, give me
their authorities. One thing I am certain of; if such horrible
deeds were ever perpetrated within those walls, there remains
no <em>living</em> witness to testify of them. The lips of those who
alone could tell the whole truth are sealed in a silence which
the trump of doom alone shall break.</p>

<p>It was, of course, no fear of any personal violence or any
painful disclosures in that respect, that made me reluctant to
receive my Endowments, for at that time I was by profession
apparently a good Mormon; if I had my doubts and misgivings,
I had them in common with nine-tenths of the Mormon
women, and had therefore nothing to fear. The true
cause of my reluctance was of a more delicate and personal
nature. I had been informed that, if I refused to go, my husband
could not go alone; he would be compelled to take another
wife, and go with her. This was not all. I found that it was
quite common for the Elders to take a second wife when they
took their first Endowments, and thus, as they coarsely expressed
it, “kill two birds with one stone.” Moreover, I had heard of
men who feared to introduce Polygamy into their households,
presenting to their wives, while going through the House, a
young girl as their intended bride, feeling sure that the wife
would not dare to make a scene before the Assembly. How
could I know that my husband also had not such an idea in his
mind? True, I trusted him implicitly, and did not believe it
possible that he could deceive me. But had not men who
were universally known for their integrity and honour acted in
the same way to <em>their</em> wives; and with so many evidences of
the best and most honest natures being corrupted by the
unrighteous teachings of their religion, could I be blamed for
doubting him whom I loved best?</p>

<p>There was also another reason why I particularly objected
to passing through the Endowment House. I had been told
many strange and revolting stories about the ceremonies which
were there performed, for it was said that in the Nauvoo Temple
the most disgraceful things were done. About what was done
at Nauvoo I can say nothing, as it was before my time, but
still it is only fair to say, that people who in every other relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in life I should have deemed most reliable and trustworthy
were my informants respecting those strange stories. Of the
Endowments in Utah I can, of course, speak more positively,
as I myself passed through them; and I wish to say most distinctly
that, although the initiation of the Saints into “The
Kingdom,” appears now to my mind as a piece of the most
ridiculous absurdity, there was, nevertheless, nothing in it indecent
or immoral—of which the reader himself shall presently
be the judge.</p>

<p>It is an invariable rule among the Mormons, as I have before
intimated, for every man or woman to mind his or her own business,
and nothing else. Thus it was, that until I myself went
through the Endowments, I was totally ignorant of what they
were; although, of course, many people, with whom I had
daily intercourse could easily have enlightened me if they
had been thus minded. Besides this, every Mormon’s mouth
was closed by the oath of that same Endowment House—the
penalty of which was death, a penalty which no one doubted
would be sternly enforced. Thus, totally in the dark, and
remembering only the strange stories told about “washings”
and “anointings,” and an imitation of the Garden of Eden,
with Adam and Eve clothed in their own innocence alone, it
can be no wonder that any modest woman should wish to
evade all participation in such scenes.</p>

<p>I spoke to my husband about it, and he tried to reassure me,
but what he said had rather a contrary effect.</p>

<p>Before we left England, when speaking of these ceremonies,
my husband told me that they were simply a privilege and a
matter of choice. But what a choice! I might go or refuse to
go; but, if I refused, he must—if he went through it all—take
another wife in my place, and, as I knew, there would be no
difficulty in finding one. I should in consequence be known as
a rebellious woman; annoyance and indignity would be heaped
upon me; while within my own home I should be compelled
to occupy the position of second wife—as the one who is
married first in the Endowment House is considered the first
wife, and has the control of everything.</p>

<p>My husband told me that now he was most anxious to go; he
had already been notified three times that such was his privilege,
and there were, he said, good reasons why we ought
gladly to accept the opportunity. It was an honour, he said,
for which many people had waited for years.</p>

<p>My husband reminded me that we had been married by a
Gentile, and while living among Gentiles, and that, as I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
before, our marriage was not valid, and our children were not
legitimate. Only those children of ours who were born <em>after</em>
the ceremony in the Endowment House would be legitimate;
the others were outcasts from the “Kingdom” unless we
adopted them <em>after</em> our initiation, and thus made them heirs.
In any case, poor children, they could never be considered
the <em>real</em> heirs; they could only be “heirs by adoption.”</p>

<p>So I agreed to go, trying to persuade myself that it was a
sacred duty; for, although my faith in Mormonism had been
roughly shaken, I still believed that its origin was divine.</p>

<p>The Temple robe, which is a long, loose, flowing garment,
made of white linen or bleached muslin, and reaching to the
ankle, had been placed upon us just before we took the oaths.
It was gathered to a band about twelve inches long, which
rested on the right shoulder, passed across the breast, and came
together under the left arm, and was then fastened by a linen
belt. This leaves the left arm entirely free. The veil consists
of a large square of Swiss muslin, gathered in one corner so
as to form a sort of cap to fit the head; the remainder falls
down as a veil. The men wear the same kind of under garment
as the women, and their robes are the same, but their
head-dress is a round piece of linen drawn up with a string
and a bow in front, something after the fashion of a Scotch
cap. All good Mormons, after they have received their first
Endowments, get whole suits of Temple robes made on purpose
for them, so that they may be ready for use at any time
when they are needed. All marriages in the Endowment
House are performed in these robes, and in them all Saints
who have received their Endowments are buried. Besides our
robes we were instructed to take with us a bottle of the best
olive oil.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock in the morning of the day appointed, we
presented ourselves at the door of the Endowment House, and
were admitted by Brother Lyon, the Mormon poet. Everything
within was beautifully neat and clean, and a solemn
silence pervaded the whole place. The only sound that could
be heard was the splashing of water, but whence the sound
proceeded we could not see. In spite of myself, a feeling of
dread and uncertainty respecting what I had to go through
would steal over my mind, and I earnestly wished that the day
was over.</p>

<p>We waited patiently for a little while, and presently a man
entered and seated himself at a table placed there for that purpose,
upon which was a large book. He opened the book, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
then calling each person in turn, he took their names and ages,
and the names of their fathers and mothers, and carefully entered
each particular in the book. Our bottles of oil were
then taken from us, and we were supposed to be ready for the
ceremony.</p>

<p>First we were told to take off our shoes, and leave them in
the anteroom, and then to take up our bundles and pass into
another room beyond. This was a large bath-room, which was
divided down the middle by a curtain of heavy material placed
there for the purpose of separating the men from the women.
Here my husband left me—he going to the men’s and I to the
women’s division. In the bath-room were two or three large
bathing-tubs supplied by streams of hot and cold water. We
were as much concealed from the men as if we had been in an
entirely separate room, and everything was very quiet and
orderly.</p>

<p>Miss Eliza R. Snow, the poetess, and a Mrs. Whitney, were
the officiating attendants on that occasion. The former conducted
me to one of the bathing-tubs, and placing me in it, she
proceeded to wash me from the crown of my head to the soles
of my feet. As she did this she repeated various formulas to
the effect that I was now washed clean from the blood of this
generation and should never, if I remained faithful, be partaker
in the plagues and miseries which were about to come upon
the earth. When I had thus been washed clean, she wiped
me dry, and then taking a large horn filled with the olive oil
which we had brought, she anointed me. The oil was poured
from the horn by Mrs. Whitney into the hand of Eliza Snow,
who then applied it to me. The horn was said to be the horn
of plenty which, like the widow’s cruse of oil, would never fail
as long as the ordinance should continue to be administered.
In addition to the crown of my head, my eyes, ears, and mouth
were also anointed; my eyes that they might be quick to see,
my ears that they might be apt at hearing, and my mouth that
I might with wisdom speak the words of eternal life. She
also anointed my feet, that they might be swift to run in the
ways of the Lord. I was then given a certain garment to
put on.</p>

<p>Now this garment is one peculiar to the Mormon people.
It is made so as to envelope the whole body, and it is worn
night and day. I was told that after having once put it on, I
must never wholly take it off before putting on another, but
that I should change one half at a time, and that if I did so
I should be protected from disease, and even from death itself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
for the bullet of an enemy would not penetrate that garment,
and that from it even the dagger’s point should be turned
aside. It has been said that the Prophet Joseph carelessly
left off this peculiar garment on the day of his death, and that,
had he not done so, the rifles of his assassins would have been
harmless against him.</p>

<p>When thus arrayed, I proceeded to put on a white nightdress
and skirt, stockings, and white linen shoes. A new name
was then whispered into my ear, which I was told I must never
mention to any living soul except my husband in the Endowment
House. This name was taken from the Bible, and I was
given to understand that it would be the name whereby I
should be admitted into the celestial kingdom. This was of
course very gratifying. A circumstance, however, occurred
which took from me all the pride which might have been mine
in the possession of a new name. There was among our number
a deaf woman; Mrs. Whitney had to tell her her name
once or twice over, loud enough for me to hear, and thus I
found that her new name, as well as mine, was Sarah. To
make the matter worse, another sister whispered, “Why, that
is my name too.” This entirely dispelled any enthusiasm
which otherwise I might have felt. I could well understand
that I might yet become a Sarah in Israel, but if we all were
Sarahs, there would not be much distinction or honour in being
called by that name. As a matter of course I supposed that
the men would all become Abrahams.</p>

<p>Our washing and anointing being now over, we were ready
for the initiation—there were about fifteen couples in all.</p>

<p>A voice from behind the curtain asked Miss Snow if we
were ready, and was answered in the affirmative. We were
then arranged in a row, the curtain was drawn aside, and we
stood face to face with the men, who had, of course, on their
side of the curtain, been put through the same ordeal. I felt
dreadfully nervous, for I did not know what was coming next,
and I could not quite dismiss from my mind the stories that I
had heard about these mysteries. But in spite of my nervousness,
curiosity was strong in me at that moment, as it
was, I suppose, in the others; for, as soon as the curtain was
drawn aside, we all cast our eyes in the direction of the men.
They, as might be expected, were looking in our direction, and
when I beheld them I must say that my sympathies were
drawn out towards the poor creatures. However little vanity
or personal pride they possessed, they must have felt it
unpleasant to have to appear in the presence of ladies in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a dress—or rather <em>un</em>dress; and notwithstanding the solemn
meaning of the ceremony, there was just the ghost of a smile
upon our faces as we looked at each other and dropped our
eyes again. To any one who did not feel as we did the religious
nature of the initiation, the scene must have appeared perfectly
ludicrous. In fact, some of us felt it so. One sister, just as
the curtain was drawn up and we came in full view of our
lords, cried out, “Oh dear, oh dear, where shall I go? What
shall I do?” This, as may be supposed, caused a laugh, which
was, of course, immediately suppressed.</p>

<p>We could see how the men looked, but of our own appearance
we could not so easily judge. Certainly, we must have
looked anything but handsome in our white garments, and
with the oil trickling down our faces and into our eyes, making
them smart and look red. There was nothing, however, for
us to do but to submit quietly and make the best of it we
could. Ashamed as I was, I thought I might venture to look
at my husband; there could be no harm in that; but when I
saw his demure-looking countenance and his efforts to keep
his clothing in order, I thought I should be compelled to laugh
outright, for I could see that his thoughts were more occupied
about his personal appearance than with the solemnity of the
occasion. The men were all dressed in the same kind of garment
as the women—drawers and shirt all in one, very much
like those which are used for children to sleep in, and over
that an ordinary white shirt, such as men always wear; that,
with socks and white linen shoes, completed their toilet.</p>

<p>Clad after this interesting fashion, we sat opposite to each
other for several minutes, and then my husband and myself
were instructed to come forward and kneel at the altar while
all the rest remained standing. It is the custom thus to select
two persons, and we were either picked out by chance, or it
might be, as my husband was thought a good deal of by the
authorities, that they considered he would feel honoured by the
preference.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice was heard speaking to some one, who also
replied. This voice from the unseen was supposed to be the
voice of Elohim in conversation with Jehovah, and the words
that were used were much the same as those contained in the
first chapter of the book of Genesis, describing the creation
of the world. Finally, Jehovah and Elohim declare their
intention to come down and visit the earth. This they do,
and pronounce all that they behold very good; but they declare
that it is necessary that one of a higher order of intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
than the brute creation should be placed in the world to
govern and control all else.</p>

<p>Michael the Archangel is now called, and he is placed upon
the earth under the name of Adam, and power is given him
over all the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the
fishes of the sea. Moreover, the fruits of the earth are all
given to him for his sustenance and pleasure; but he is strictly
charged, as in Bible story, not to eat of one particular tree
which stands in the midst of the garden. This tree is represented
by a small real evergreen, and a few bunches of dried
raisins are hung upon it as fruit.</p>

<p>It is now discovered that it is not good for man to be alone;
Elohim and Jehovah, therefore, hold another conversation
upon that subject, and they finally determine to give a companion
to Adam. They, therefore, cause a deep sleep to fall
upon Michael—or Adam as he is now called—and they prepare
to operate upon him. Here we were all instructed to
assume the attitude of deep sleep by dropping our heads upon
our breasts. Elohim and Jehovah then come down and go
through the motions of removing a rib from the side of the
sleeper, which said rib appears immediately upon the scene in
the person of Eliza R. Snow. Elohim and Jehovah are generally
represented by two of the Twelve Apostles. When
Brigham is present he plays a prominent part.</p>

<p>And now the devil makes his appearance in the person of
W. W. Phelps. Phelps used always to personate the devil in
the Endowments, and the <i lang="fr">rôle</i> suited him admirably. He is
dead now, but whether it has made any difference in his <em>status</em>
I cannot tell, nor do I know who has succeeded him in his
office. The devil wears a very tight-fitting suit of black muslin,
with knee-breeches and black stockings and slippers. This
dress had all the appearance of a theatrical costume, and the
man looked as much like what one might imagine the devil
would look as he possibly could. He began by trying to
scrape acquaintance with Eve, whom he meets while taking a
walk in the garden. The innocent, unsuspecting woman is
fascinated by his attentions. Father Adam—who seems to
have had a touch of the Mormon about him—perhaps was not
the most attentive of husbands; or he may have made the
same mistake as that which so many of his sons have since made—neglecting
to pay the same attentions after marriage as he
was wont to before—and left his young wife to the mercy of
the tempter. However that may be, Satan and Eve are soon
discovered in conversation together, and Eve appears to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
particularly pleased with Satan. At length he offers her some
of the fruit of the forbidden tree, and after some little demur
she accepts it and eats thereof.</p>

<p>Then the devil leaves her, Adam makes his appearance, and
Eve persuades him also to eat of the fruit of the tree. After
this they make a dumb show of perceiving their condition,
and an apron of white linen is produced, on which are sewn
pieces of green silk, in imitation of fig leaves, and in these they
both attire themselves.</p>

<p>Then all the brethren and sisters produced similar aprons
which they had brought with them on purpose, and these they
put on, as Adam and Eve had already done. Elohim now
appeared again, and called Adam; but Adam was afraid, and
hid himself in the garden with Eve. The curse was now pronounced
upon the serpent—the devil—who reappears upon
his hands and knees, making a hissing noise as one might suppose
a serpent would do. We were then all driven out of the
Garden of Eden into another room which represented the
world—and this ended the “First Degree.”</p>

<p>We were now supposed to be out in the world, earning our
daily bread by the sweat of our brows, and we were informed
that although we had been driven out from the presence of the
Lord, yet a plan of salvation would be devised for us, by
which we should be enabled to return to our first estate.
We were to wait patiently until this plan should be disclosed
to us.</p>

<p>There was here such a mixture of persons and events that
I could not exactly follow the idea that was intended to be
conveyed—if there was any idea at all. Men representing the
ancient prophets entered, and gave instructions to the people to
prepare themselves for the first coming of our Saviour upon
earth. Then we were taught certain pass-words and grips;
and then we were all arranged in a circle. The women
covered their faces with their veils, and we all kneeled down,
and, with our right hands uplifted towards heaven, we took the
solemn oath of obedience and secrecy.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We swore that by
every means in our power we would seek to avenge the death
of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, upon the Gentiles who had
caused his murder, and that we would teach our children to
do so; we swore, that without murmur or questioning, we
would implicitly obey the commands of the priesthood in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
everything; we swore that we would not commit adultery—which,
with reference to the men, was explained to mean the
taking of wives without the permission of the holy Priesthood;
and we swore that we would never, under any circumstances,
reveal that which transpired in the Endowment House.</p>

<p>The penalty for breaking this oath, which was worded in
the most startling and impressive way, was then explained to
us. His bowels were—while he was yet living—to be torn
from him, his throat was to be cut from ear to ear, and his
heart and tongue were to be cut out. In the world to come,
everlasting damnation would be his portion.</p>

<p>Let not the reader think that this was merely an imaginary
penalty, or that it was expressed merely for the purpose of
frightening the weak-minded; for, as will be shown, punishments
quite as horrible as that have been deliberately meted
out to the Apostate, the Gentile, and the suspected Saint,
by the Mormon Priesthood. The innocent blood which cries
for vengeance against Brigham Young and some of the
leaders of the Church is sufficient to weigh the purest spirit
which stands before the throne of God down to the nethermost
abysses of hell.</p>

<p>After these fearful oaths had been taken with due solemnity,
we were instructed in the various signs representing
those dreadful penalties; and we were also given a “grip”
peculiar to this degree.</p>

<p>We were next entertained by a long address from the
Apostle Heber C. Kimball.—Never in my life—except from
Brigham Young—have I listened to such disgusting language,
and I trust I never shall be compelled to listen to anything
like it again. Brother Kimball always used to pride himself
upon using “plain” language, but that day I think he surpassed
himself; he seemed to take quite a pleasure in saying
anything which could make us blush. The subject of which
he discoursed was the married life in the “Celestial Order;”
he also laid great stress upon the necessity of our keeping
silence concerning all that we had witnessed in the Endowment
House—even husbands to their wives, and wives to their
husbands, were not to utter a single word. With the sermon
ended our “Second Degree.”</p>

<p>We were now taken to another room for the purpose of passing
through the “Third Degree” of the Order of the Melchisedec
Priesthood. When we were all arranged on one side
against the wall, a number of individuals entered who were
supposed to represent the ministers of every denomination and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
religion upon the face of the earth. The devil also makes his
appearance again. The ministers set forth the various claims
of their respective creeds—each one striving to show that
his is the purest and the best—but the devil sows division
and hatred among them, and a good deal of confusion
ensues.</p>

<p>Then came in personages representing Peter, James, and
John, the Apostles; and they commanded ministers, devil, and
all to depart. They then appeared to organize a new Church,
in which the true principles of the Gospel were to be taught;
our Temple robes were also all changed from the right
shoulder to the left, indicating that we were now in the true
Church, and that we were to be absolutely and in every way
dependent upon the priesthood. Another grip was then given
to us, and thus we received the third degree of the Order of
Melchisedec Priesthood. In that room was a division made of
bleached muslin; in the division a door and in the door a hole,
with a lap of muslin over it, through which to pass the hand.
Whoever was on the other side could see us, but we could not
see them. The men first approached this door. A person
representing the Apostle Peter appeared at the opening and
demanded who was there. He was told that some one desired
to enter. Hands came through the opening in the muslin
curtain, and mysterious fingers cut a mark on the left breast
of the men’s shirts—one mark also over the abdomen, and one
over the right knee—which marks the women religiously imitated
upon their own garments when they got home. The
applicant was then told to put his hand through the opening,
and give the last grip belonging to the “Third Degree,” and
mention his new name. He was then permitted to enter.
This was called “going behind the veil.” When the men
were all admitted, the women were suffered to approach, and
were passed through by their own husbands. When a woman
has no husband she is passed through by one of the brethren,
and to those who are not going to be married or sealed for
eternity here the ceremonies end.</p>

<p>Now, as I before stated, according to Mormon ideas we had
never before been legally married. It was therefore, necessary
that we should now pass through that ceremony. We
accordingly were conducted to a desk, where our names were
entered, and we were then passed into another room. In that
room was a long, low altar, covered with red velvet, and an
armchair placed at one end of it, in which sat Brigham
Young. My husband knelt at one side of the altar and I at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the other, with our hands clasped above it in the last grip
which had been given to us. Then the ordinary formula of
marriage was gone through with, and we were informed that
we were sealed for time and for eternity.</p>

<p>Thus we passed through the mysteries of the Endowment
House, and at three o’clock in the afternoon we found ourselves
at liberty to return home. The various ceremonies had
occupied eight hours.</p>

<p>When we reached home, my husband said, “Well, what do
you think of the Endowments?” But I did not dare to
answer him truthfully at that time. Had I done so, I should
have told him that I was ashamed and disgusted. Never in
all my life did I suffer such humiliation as I did that day; for
the whole time I was under the impression that those who
officiated looked upon us as a set of silly dupes, and I felt
annoyed to think that I dared not tell them so. So I told my
husband that I would rather not speak about it, and we never
have spoken of it to this day. What were his own feelings
about the matter, I do not know, for Mormon wives are taught
never to pry into their husband’s feelings or meddle with their
actions. But notwithstanding all my feelings in reference to
the Endowments, so foolish was I that when I afterwards
heard the brethren and sisters talking about the happiness
which they had experienced while going through, and saying
how privileged we ought to feel at being in Zion among the
Saints of God, secure in His Kingdom where we could bring
up our children in the fear of the Lord, I began again to think
that the fault was all in myself, and that it was I who was
wrong and not the Endowments. I wondered how, with such
a rebellious heart, I should ever get salvation, and I mourned
to think that I had not accepted everything with the simplicity
of a child.</p>

<p>Some time after our initiation I met the Apostle Heber C.
Kimball, and he asked me how I felt upon the occasion. I
frankly told him all, but added that I regretted feeling so.
He said, “I shall see if you cannot go through again; it is
not just the thing, and I shall try and make the opportunity.”
Nothing more, however, was said about it. But that which
troubled me most was the fact that while the oaths were being
administered, I dropped my hand and inwardly vowed that I
would never subscribe to such things, and at the same time
my heart was filled with bitter opposition. This, although I
did it involuntarily—my better nature rising within me, and
overcoming my superstition—I thought at the time was sinful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
I now, however, rejoice that such was the case; for not having
actually vowed to keep secret those abominable oaths, I can
say, without any cavil or equivocation, that I have broken no
promise and betrayed no trust by the revelations which I have
just made.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SECRETS OF SAINTLY SPOUSES:—A VISIT FROM MY
TALKATIVE FRIEND.</span></h2>

<p>Not long after I had received my Endowments, my talkative
friend, of whom I have already spoken, came to see me and
to offer her congratulations. She was quite enthusiastic upon
the subject, spoke of the honour which had been conferred
upon us, and promised to call frequently “to build me up.”
She was particularly anxious to learn whether I did not feel
much better and happier now.</p>

<p>On that point I could say little, for to have answered her
truthfully would have provoked discussion, into which I did
not care to enter. I knew, too, that anything I said to her
would soon be known to every one else. So I told her that I
was feeling well enough.</p>

<p>“‘Well enough!’” she said. “Is that how you feel?
Come now, I thought you would have got over all that when you
had been through your Endowments. You remind me of
what Brother Brigham says,—We have so many whining
women in Zion that it is quite a reproach. I do hope that
you are not going to become one of them. Let me give you a
bit of advice: The wisest thing that you can do is to look
out for another wife for your husband, and get him to marry
her.”</p>

<p>“Oh my!” I said; “what are you talking about? You
surely cannot be in earnest.”</p>

<p>“I never was more earnest in my life,” she answered. “If
you had persuaded your husband to take another wife when
you went through your Endowments, you would have got over
all your troubles at one time. The anticipation is ten times
worse than the reality.”</p>

<p>“I do not see it in that light,” I said. “My own opinion
is that my troubles in that case would only then have begun.
I do not think that you yourself are really happy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” she exclaimed. “Why you can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
how happy I am. My husband has two other wives, besides
myself, and a more comfortable family could not be.”</p>

<p>“You never told me,” I said, “how your husband managed
to get those wives. I should like to hear.”</p>

<p>“My husband managed! Why <em>he</em> did not manage at all;
it was I who arranged everything for him, and I’ll tell you
how it was done.</p>

<p>“During the Reformation,” she continued, “you, of course,
know the men were constantly urged to take more wives; but
my husband was rather backward, and used to tell me there
was plenty of time, and not the slightest occasion for him to
be in a hurry. I had my own opinion of the matter and did
not agree with him, for you see I was afraid that after all, he
would pick up some young girl or other and fall in love with
her, and all my plans would be disarranged. It is, you know
much the best for the first wife to look out for some girl who
will look up to her and respect her, but not love her husband
too much, and then they are likely to get on well together.
If the first wife selects the other wives, it has the effect of
showing them that the husband thinks much of her judgment
and is willing to abide by it, and that they will have to do
the same. This, of course, is as it should be. But if she
lets her husband choose his own wife, he is almost certain to
take a fancy to some one whom the first wife does not like
at all, and consequently her authority is undermined. The
first wife ought to keep all the power in her own hands.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I should not care much, I think, who
ruled in my home if another wife was there.”</p>

<p>“You think so now,” she replied; “but when you get used
to polygamy you will feel quite otherwise. People get used
to it—the women as well as the men—and then they leave off
fretting and become less selfish. But I was going to tell you
how I managed my husband.</p>

<p>“I was very anxious, as I told you, to find another wife
for him, and I took into consideration all the suitable girls I
knew. There was some objection to almost every one. Some
were too pretty and I knew I should detest them; and others
were not good-looking, and those my husband could not bear.
So I waited patiently, but did not give up the hope of succeeding
eventually. At last I met with a girl who I thought
would do. She was certainly not bad-looking, but she was
very young, and I thought I should be able to manage her.
The name of this girl was Alice Maynard; she was a neighbour
of ours, and one of a large family. She seemed to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to be a quiet modest little creature, and I knew that she had
to work hard and received very little in return. In fact, she
led at home a life of drudgery, and even her very clothing
bore witness to the poverty of the family. Her mother had
often told me that she felt badly for Alice, for Mr. Maynard
had three other wives, and it was more than he could do to
support them all properly.</p>

<p>“I called one day on Mrs. Maynard to broach the matter
to her. She received me very kindly, and entered into my
views at once. She was anxious, she said, for Alice to get
married, for then she would be better off. I asked her how
she would like her to marry my husband, and told her that we
were very comfortably off—as you know we are—and that
my husband owned his house and lot, and was doing a very
good business, and, of course, ought to take another wife.
Would she agree to my proposal, and let me mention Alice to
him?</p>

<p>“She said she herself had no objection, but that perhaps
my husband might not like Alice, or Alice might not like
him.</p>

<p>“I felt indignant at the idea that any girl should hesitate to
marry <em>my</em> husband, and I told Sister Maynard that there could
not possibly be any hesitation on Alice’s part. ‘I’m sure I
have no objection,’ she said, ‘if Alice has none. I should
only be too happy to see my child in a more comfortable
home.’</p>

<p>“Well, then, we’ll consider the matter settled, I said, and
asked if I could see Alice; so her mother called her in, and
I proposed to her for my husband. You can guess, perhaps,
how astonished I was when she actually laughed in my face,
and said she should like to consider the matter! I did not,
however, show her what I thought, but assented to what she
said, and invited her to come and take tea with us.</p>

<p>“My husband had often told me, when I was teasing him
about taking another wife, that he would willingly marry <em>any</em>
girl I might choose for him; and I felt pleased at this, for it
showed confidence in my judgment. So when he came in,
later in the day, I told him I had found a wife for him at last,
and that I knew he would like her. ‘Why, Ann,’ he said,
‘I do believe you are going crazy over the wife question; but
if you are, I do not want you to drive me crazy also.’ I really
thought this was too bad, after all my trouble for him;
but nevertheless I was resolved that the marriage should take
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Three days after that, in accordance with my invitation,
Alice came to take tea with us, and I fixed her up to look
nice. When she was ready, I took her into the parlour to
introduce her to my husband, who was sitting there reading.
Henry, I said, this is Miss Maynard—the young lady of whom
I spoke to you the other day. He looked up from his paper,
and, to my astonishment, said, ‘Why, Alice, my girl, how do
you do? How are mother and father?’</p>

<p>“‘What, I said, do you know Alice, Henry?’”</p>

<p>“‘Certainly I do,” he answered; ‘Alice and I have met
many times before this, haven’t we, Alice?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir,’ she said, and, oh, <em>so</em> demurely. Why, Sister
Stenhouse, I began to think that I had actually been deceived,
and that while I had innocently supposed that I had found
out the girl myself, it was the very one upon whom my
husband had had his eye for a long while past. I watched
them, however, very narrowly, for I was determined that if
my husband had really taken a fancy for the girl he should
never have her.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would have facilitated matters, would it not?”
I said.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” she replied, “that I would have allowed
them to marry if they loved each other? No, indeed! The
Saints marry from principle and not from love, as Brother
Brigham has often told us. I hope you believe me, dear,
when I say that I am not at all a jealous woman, but if my
husband dared to fall in love with a girl and to hide it from
me, I could not stand it I am sure. No! <em>principle</em> is the
only thing—there can be no love in Polygamy. If a man
loved his wife, do you think he could have the heart to pain
her by taking another? On the other hand, it is because
of the love which still remains in their hearts, and which
they weary themselves to crush out, that so many of the first
wives are miserable. But I was going to tell you about
Alice. I was mistaken in thinking that my husband had been
paying her any attentions. It appeared that he was acquainted
with her father and mother, and that at their house he had
frequently seen the child Alice, but never supposed she was
the Miss Maynard of whom I had spoken. But now they
had come together at last he took to her kindly and she to
him, and really I sometimes almost thought they wished to
ignore me altogether.</p>

<p>“I did not let them waste much time fussing with one
another, but they got on very rapidly, nevertheless; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
before I had time to arrange matters properly, my husband
told me that <em>to please me</em> he was going to marry Alice. Only
fancy me being pleased at him marrying Alice! Why, it wasn’t
to please myself that I introduced the child to him, but
simply because, if he <em>must</em> have another wife, it was certainly
best for me to choose one whom I could manage. However,
they were married not long after, and really I think I never
was more disgusted in my life than I was on that occasion.
I was not jealous, but I do think he might have paid her a
little less attention. In fact I quite regretted, when it was
too late, that I had ever brought them together.</p>

<p>“The Mormon men always do make themselves silly over
their new wives, and I did not expect my husband to be an
exception to the rule; but I was perfectly astonished at the
change that took place in Alice. Instead of the quiet, modest
girl she used to be, she put on all sorts of airs, and treated
me as if I were of not the slightest consequence. I couldn’t
stand that, and I resolved, if it were only to take the pride
out of her, I would get my husband to marry another wife
still. He wouldn’t object, I knew, for he takes life very
easily, and he has a great respect for my opinion. Besides
which, he is quite well enough off to support three wives;
and as a matter of duty, if nothing else, he ought to do so.
That would soon bring Miss Alice to a proper state of mind,
and she needed something of the sort; for, do you know, she
had actually made that silly husband of mine think that
she ought to be treated with the same consideration as myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, but,” I said, “if the principle of polygamy is of
God, it is only just that all the wives should be treated alike.
If my husband were to marry another woman, much as it
would pain me, I should treat her as an equal.”</p>

<p>“Then,” she replied, “if you do so you will find that the
first wives will have nothing to do with you. You will find,
when you come to be better acquainted with the people here,
that the first wives do not waste much love over the polygamic
wives; and, of course, as a rule, the polygamic wives
detest the first wives. Then the plural wives get together
and talk all manner of evil about the first wives, who do
pretty much the same in respect to them. It is only natural
that they should do so.</p>

<p>“But I was going to tell you,” she continued, “how I
selected the third wife. There was an emigrant-train expected
in every day; and you know, when the emigrants arrive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
all those women who want wives for their husbands, and all
those men who want to choose for themselves, go down to the
camping-ground, and if they see a girl who takes their fancy
they ask her if she has got a place to go to, and if she has
not they offer to receive her themselves. There are hundreds
of young girls who arrive here without any one to look after
them, and who are only too glad to accept a home for the
winter. Now this was exactly what I did. I went down to
the camp and looked round for myself, and at last my eyes rested
upon a young woman of about thirty or thirty-five years of age,
who I thought would be a more suitable wife for my husband
than that giggling chit that I chose for him at first. I decided
at once that she would do, so I went up to her and asked
her if she had any friends. She said she had a brother living
in the City; but when I explained to her how we were situated,
and said that I should like her to come and stay with us
till she could look round a little for herself, she agreed at
once. Now—I thought—Miss Alice, we shall see whether
you are going to have things all your own way any
longer!</p>

<p>“I told her, however, as well as my husband, that I had
brought home a sister to stay with us a while, and they received
her very kindly, and she soon made herself very useful
and agreeable to us all. The bishop came and talked to my
husband, and he made no difficulty at all in acceding to my
wishes, and before long he made our visitor wife number
three; and Alice, as a matter of course, lost a good deal of
her influence over him. For my own part, I am much more
comfortable. The two plural wives do nearly all the work,
and I have little else to do than superintend the household
and enjoy myself. My husband is one of those quiet sort
of men who never interfere with domestic affairs, and I have
matters pretty much my own way now. The only thing that
annoys me is his fondness for Alice, who makes herself appear
most amiable <em>to him</em>, deceitful thing! I can’t break him of
that, but I often tell him that he will find her out some day.
He tells me that he looks upon her as a child, and feels like
a father towards her; no woman, he says, can ever have his
love but me. That sounds all very well; but as to believing it,
that is quite another thing—I keep my eye on them, and
watch them well.”</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “it appears to me that it would have been
far better if you had never given him another wife at all,
you would have been saved from annoyance, and the privacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of your home would not have been disturbed. I am the
more surprised, as your husband did not himself desire
it.”</p>

<p>“When you understand better the order of the kingdom,
you will not speak in that way,” she said. “Do you suppose
that I shall be satisfied to be the wife of a man who could
not exalt me in the celestial kingdom—a man with only one
wife? Why I have often told my husband that if he did not
get other wives I would leave. It is necessary for a man to
have two wives, at least, if he would enter into the celestial kingdom.
That is why I have been so anxious to get wives for
my husband. At the same time there is no necessity for him
to fall in love, and act in a silly way over them. The only
way in such a case is to set one to watch the other, and then
they are pretty certain to keep the old man straight. You
think, perhaps, that I don’t feel all this, but you must not
be deceived by appearances. I try to do the will of heaven
with a smile on my face; and the brethren have often told me
that if the other sisters were more like me they would not have
so much difficulty in establishing Polygamy. But, dear me,
Sister Stenhouse, what a long talk we’ve had! I’ll come and
see you soon again, but I must hasten away now, for my husband
will be home to supper by this time.”</p>

<p>So she left me wondering over her strange story of a
woman’s experience in supplying her own husband with
wives.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOCIAL LIFE IN SALT LAKE CITY:—BALL-ROOMS, “WALL-FLOWERS,”
AND DIVORCE.</span></h2>

<p>We had not been long in Salt Lake City before the ball-season
commenced. These balls afford splendid opportunities
to the men for flirting with the girls. No matter how old and
homely a man is, he thinks that he has as much right to flirt
and dance with the girls as the youngest boy; for they all
look upon themselves and each other as boys and single men, even
if they have a dozen wives. There is no limit to their “privileges.”
They are always in the market. Brigham, in his public
discourses, has said that the brethren “are all young men under
a hundred years of age.” With such an extended privilege,
it is here in Utah that hoary Winter and smiling May can be
seen galloping forth in the dance together—a thoughtful
subject for the artist’s pencil.</p>

<p>It is of no consequence how much a man may flirt in the
presence of his wife or wives. They must not presume to say
one word to him about it; for the husband is free to do whatever
he likes. He is one of the lords of creation. He is
master of his wives, of his children. Then, how can one of
his own dare to call in question anything he may think fit to do?
She <em>may</em>, it is true, do so; but she must take the consequences
of that rash act.</p>

<p>Oh! how I loathe even the very remembrance of those
hateful ball-rooms, where I have seen so many unhappy
wives, and have heard so many tales of sorrow. For, while
the wives would be sitting as “wall-flowers” along the sides
of the halls, after having danced the first dance with their
husbands, as a matter of form, I have heard them many times
telling each other about what they had seen their husbands doing
during the evening; and how they had been compelled to
pay attention to some simpering girl that their husbands
chanced to fancy; and how they had had to do it for peace
sake, and appear to be satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not mean to say that I did not like these social amusements
myself, for I did; and could, under other circumstances,
have enjoyed them very much. But I had been told so many
things of the unpleasantness of a ball-room in Salt Lake City—at
least, to married women—that my apprehensions were
aroused. But all that was ever told me never half came up to
the truth; nor can I possibly myself give the reader any correct
idea of the heartaches and sorrows which these scenes
bring to the wives of Mormons.</p>

<p>It is quite a common thing for married men to go with
young girls to these balls. The majority of the men, however,
prefer to take their first wives with them at the same
time; but it is not infrequent to hear a lady say in the ball-room,
“My husband has brought his girl here to-night; but
I have not spoken one word to her, nor will I do so.” Yet, if
any one were to ask these same ladies if they believed that
Polygamy was right, they would say, “Certainly I do; but I
do not like <em>her</em>”—and this simply because their husbands had
paid <em>her</em> attentions. This seems like inconsistency; but it
serves to show what conflicting feelings Mormon women have
to contend with.</p>

<p>The men should hear what their wives say about them in
the ball-rooms, and the hatred they feel for them. I have
seen some women sitting quietly eyeing their husbands, as they
danced or flirted with their younger loves, till their cup of indignation
was full. Then they would make for the dressing-rooms,
where their anger would burst upon the ears of a
group of eager listeners, who were seemingly pleased to learn
that some one else was suffering as well as themselves. A
half-repressed threat, “I will be even with him” has escaped
the lips of those who, before that, had passed for being
happily situated.</p>

<p>Where new matrimonial alliances are continually taking place,
the arrival of a gentleman, with his wife, wives, or a maiden, in
the ball-room, is never remarked; and, not infrequently, different
wives arrive at different hours during the evenings, as
it suits their convenience; and thus it would be difficult to
say who came with their “lord.” Besides, no observation is
made if a lady thus enters the ball-room alone, though it is
expected that her husband is aware of her coming. This
coming alone, however, is not a common habit; but, as it is admissible,
it does occasionally happen that a husband is dancing
or enjoying himself in the ball-room with his last <i lang="fr">fiancée</i>,
when a vigilant pair of eyes searches over the room and lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
upon the happy “lord.” When eyes like these encounter the
eyes they seek, a change is seen, and the youthful airiness of
the gentleman vanishes, and sober looks follow the gaiety of
the earlier hour.</p>

<p>I met President Heber C. Kimball at one of these balls,
soon after my arrival. He said that he would introduce me
to <em>his wife</em>. Every one liked Heber for his outspoken, honest
bluntness. He took me up the hall and introduced me to five
wives in succession! “Now,” said he, “I think I’ll quit;
for I fancy you are not over strong in the faith.”</p>

<p>I asked, “Are these all you have got?”</p>

<p>“O dear, no,” he said: “I have <em>a few more at home</em>, and
<em>about fifty more</em> scattered over the earth somewhere. I
have never seen them since they were sealed to me in Nauvoo,
and I hope I never shall again.”</p>

<p>I thought this was terrible; but it was only the beginning
of worse things.</p>

<p>After this winter, I had very little peace; for the women
were constantly talking to me about my husband getting
another wife. He held out, however, for five years; but at
last he “felt that it was his duty to do so,” and I was silly
enough to allow that “he was not living up to his religion”
unless he took an extra wife.</p>

<p>I shall never forget those ball-room scenes. Even to this
day, when I chance to listen to tunes which I used to hear
played in those times, they grate terribly upon my ear, and
bring back so many sad recollections, that I want to get away
from the sound of them as quickly as possible, for they are
more than I can endure. Bygone recollections are often recalled
by trifles such as this.</p>

<p>A few months ago I attended a ball in Salt Lake City. It
was the first I had been to since I withdrew from the Church;
and of course it was got up by the “Liberal Party.” I felt
free and happy, for there was nothing to annoy or disturb me.
Suddenly the band struck up a tune which I had heard while
attending the Mormon balls. It sounded like the death-knell
of all my pleasant feelings, and aroused memories of the past
which were so intensely painful that I could not rally from
the depression that I felt for the rest of the evening. I had
heard that tune before, and many like it, and had even danced
to it, while my heart was breaking.</p>

<p>Let me ask my lady readers—those, I mean, who have
never been in Utah. Ladies, how do you think you would feel
if <em>you</em> were kept waiting long after the hour of midnight, far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
away into the morning, until your husbands had got through
with their dancing and flirting, while your own hearts were
breaking? I think I hear you say, “I would not stand it.”
You do not know, I assure you, <em>what</em> you would do under the
circumstances. How can you possibly judge what the feelings
of a Mormon woman are, who has been taught to believe that
“her desire shall be unto her husband, <em>and he shall rule over her</em>.”</p>

<p>In very early days Brigham built a theatre, and a very
fair amount of histrionic talent was developed among the
Saints. The Social Hall, in which were held balls, public
entertainments, and other amusements, was used for histrionic
performances before the theatre was built. Brigham owned
the theatre. Money was to be made out of it; and the chance
of making money Brother Brigham never permitted to slip
through his fingers. Brigham’s eyes were sharp enough to
see that a theatre would be to him a source of profit, but he
did not look far enough. That theatre—under the immediate
direction of the Prophet, with his own daughters acting
in it, with the plays which were performed under his
own censorship—has been one of the many causes which have
perceptibly, although perhaps indirectly, shaken the hold
which Mormonism had upon many a woman’s mind.</p>

<p>A man would probably witness the performance of a play
and return from the theatre with no other thought than the
remembrance of an hour’s amusement. But not so a woman.
To her the play suggested something more, and her daughters
would share her thoughts. Daily and hourly, it might be, the
effects of Polygamy would be brought under their notice as a
matter affecting themselves personally. They might be firm
in the faith, but the observant instincts of their sex could
never be wholly crushed. They would notice the neglect
which wives endured even from good husbands; they would
see a man leaving the wife of his youth, the mother of his
children, and, careless of the cruel wrong he did her, leave her
in lonely sorrow while he was spending his time in love-making
with some young girl who might have been his daughter.
They would see a wife crushing out from her heart the holiest
impulses which God had implanted there, striving to destroy
all affection for him whose dearest treasure that affection
should have been, because, indeed, Polygamy could not exist
with love. They would see and know, and themselves personally
feel, the degradation and misery of the “<em>Celestial</em> Order
of Marriage;” and that to them would be the practical picture
of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the theatre—short-sighted Brigham, to allow it to be
so!—another picture would be presented for their consideration;
a picture it might be, ideal in its details and surroundings,
but true to the letter in the lesson which it conveyed and the
thoughts which it suggested. The disgusting, the brutalizing
cruelties of Polygamy, were never represented on the stage.
Thoughts so coarse, so sensual, could never inspire the true
poet’s pen. No; the tale of love, as the poet tells it, is all
that is refined, and chaste, and delicate, and pure; the commingling
of two souls, the unison of two loving hearts, the
hopes, the aspirations, the tender joyful sorrows of two fond
natures—of <em>two alone</em>! Such is the picture presented as
the ideal of the beautiful and of the good. Then, too, the
delicate attentions of the devoted lover, his happiness even in
the shadow of a smile from <em>her</em>, the lofty pedestal upon which
to his imagination <em>she</em> stands, a queen and peerless; or the
confiding love of the heroine of the story; blushingly confessing
to herself that there is <em>one</em> heart on earth which is all
her own, and in which none but herself can ever rule or reign.</p>

<p>The Mormon women are not devoid of common sense, nor
are they destitute of those quick perceptions which, under all
circumstances, distinguish their sex. They see on the stage
representations of the happiness attendant upon love and marriage,
such as God ordained, and such as finds a response in
every heart; and they compare such pleasant pictures with
what they know and have witnessed of Polygamy, and they
draw painful inferences therefrom. Their faith may be proof
against apostasy, but the impression left upon their minds produces
its effect notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The spring came on, and our prospects began to brighten.
My husband not only found remunerative employment for his
pen in Salt Lake City, but was also engaged as special correspondent
to the <cite>New York Herald</cite> and several of the California
papers.</p>

<p>One morning, a countryman, roughly dressed and looking
the picture of care, called at our house and asked to see Mr.
Stenhouse. I gazed at him for a moment, for I thought there
was something familiar in the sound of his voice. He looked
at me, and I at once recognized him; it was Monsieur Balif
himself, in whose house we had lived in Switzerland. But, oh,
how changed he was! Once a refined, handsome, gentlemanly
man; now a mere wreck of his former self, careworn, rough-looking,
poorly clad. He and his family had been in Utah six
years, and had suffered all the ills that poverty can induce:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the change which was wrought in him was so great, that for
some moments I was so overcome by my feelings that I could
not utter a word. In the few short years which had elapsed
since I saw him in his own bright and happy home, he had
become quite an old man. I hardly dared to ask about his
wife, for I feared what his answer might be; but after a little
while he told me that she had sent her love, and would like to
see me whenever I could find an opportunity to call upon her.
They lived some miles from the city, but I told him that I
would not fail to visit them whenever it was possible for me to
do so.</p>

<p>I talked a long while with Monsieur Balif, and was much
interested in what he told me. He made no complaints; he
had still firm faith in Mormonism, and said that if the brethren
had not dealt fairly by him they would be answerable to God
for what they had done. “Besides,” he added, “I do not
blame them so much, for they are Americans, and would
not be happy if they did not get the advantage in some way.”</p>

<p>I was anxious to ask him if he had been induced to take
another wife, as he had been in Utah during the “Reformation,”
and I did not see how it was possible for him to have
escaped; but while I was thinking how I might put the question
delicately, he saved me the trouble by himself telling me
that he had married the young servant-girl, whom his wife had
taken from Switzerland with her. This information was quite
a shock to me, for I well knew the proud spirit of his wife, and
I could realize what anguish this second marriage must have
caused her; I did not, however, like to question him on the
subject. So I turned the conversation into another channel,
and when he went away I sent kind messages to Madame
Balif, saying that I would seize the very first opportunity
of hearing from her own lips the story of all they had gone
through.</p>

<p>Here, again, I found the trail of that monster—Polygamy.
This time in the home of my dearest friend. From the moment
when she and I had mingled our tears together in Switzerland,
over that abomination, life had been to me one long, weary,
sickening battle with my own heart; one futile attempt to fully
convince myself that Polygamy was right and that I was wrong.
I certainly did believe, or thought that I believed, the doctrine
was true. But at times nature prevailed in the struggle, and
womanly indignation and anger rose in arms against faith.
These feelings were, however, at once and unhesitatingly subdued;
faith returned triumphant, and I was again convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that the Revelation <em>must</em> have been the will of the Lord, and
that my duty was to submit, but not to question. In moments
of comparative self-control I had even tried, as a Missionary’s
wife, to justify it to others, but only to witness an outburst of
sorrow and anger, and to feel still more the weakness of my
position. That had been my own experience; but how had
the time passed with my dear old friend? She must, no doubt,
have been as greatly disappointed as I was when she came to
Zion and saw things as they really were, and not as they had
been represented to us.</p>

<p>My own eyes had certainly been opened not a little since
my arrival. Instead of finding the people enjoying the comforts
and blessings of life, which we had been taught were
strewn around them in profuse abundance, we found among
all but the leading families the greatest poverty and privation.
The majority of the people were living in little log or
adobe houses, of one or at the utmost two rooms, of most
primitive construction, and without the slightest convenience
of any description. Their food was bread and molasses, and
it might be an occasional morsel of meat; but many of them
scarcely ever indulged in the latter, or in any article of
grocery, for months at a time. Their floors and walls were
bare, and their clothing poor and scanty; and yet, destitute
as they were of all the comforts and conveniences of life, they
were conscientiously endeavouring like good Saints to practise
Polygamy, because, as they believed, the Lord had commanded
it.</p>

<p>In respect to education they were in even a worse position.
Books, pictures, and periodicals of any kind, there were none,
with the exception of that dreary organ of the church, the
<cite>Deseret News</cite>—the soporific influence of which some
wicked Apostate has likened to a dose of Winslow’s soothing
syrup. Brigham Young, himself an illiterate man, and the
leading Elders, frowned upon every attempt to raise the intellectual
<em>status</em> of the people; and so little encouragement was
given, that no one could afford to keep school. The consequence
was, that the boys and girls grew up with little more
education than their own sense of necessity taught them to
acquire for themselves; and it was not until very recently that
any suitable efforts were made to supply trained teachers and
to open schools in which a thorough education could be
afforded.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the sermons of the Tabernacle, and
observed how little calculated they were to elevate the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
or cultivate the minds of the people. I have before me as
I write a choice morsel extracted from one of the sermons of
Heber C. Kimball, which I think I must give for the reader’s
benefit.</p>

<p>Fancy an “Apostle!” thus addressing a large and mixed
congregation of men, women, and children:—</p>

<p>“Here are some edicated men jest under my nose. They
come here and they think they know more than I do, and then
they git the big head, and it swells and swells until it gits like
the old woman’s squash—you go to touch it and it goes ker-smash;
and when you look for the man, why he ain’t thar.
They’re jest like so many pots in a furnace—yer know I’ve
been a potter in my time—almighty thin and almighty big;
and when they’re sot up the heat makes ’em smoke a little,
and then they collapse and tumble in, and they aint no
whar.”</p>

<p>This was Heber’s style in general. Next to making modest
people blush, nothing pleased him better than to annoy or
ridicule any one who had the smallest pretensions to education;
and yet naturally Heber was a kind-hearted man. Brigham’s
style is very little better, and the substance of his discourses
quite as bad. I will give a very favourable specimen, taken
from a sermon on Polygamy, delivered some years ago, touched
up and corrected, and published in the official organ, the
<cite>Deseret News</cite>:—</p>

<p>“Men will say, ‘My wife, though a most excellent woman,
has not seen a happy day since I took my second wife.’ ‘No,
not a happy day for a year,’ says one; and another has not
seen a happy day for five years.</p>

<p>“I am going to set every woman at liberty, and say to them,
Now go your way—my women with the rest; go your way.
And my wives have got to do one of two things; either round
up their shoulders to endure the afflictions of this world and
live their religion, or they must leave; for I will not have
them about me. I will go into heaven alone rather than have
scratching and fighting around me. I will set all at liberty.
‘What, first wife too!’ Yes, I will liberate you all. I know
there is no cessation to the everlasting whinings of many of
the women in this territory; I am satisfied that this is the
case; and if the women will turn from the commandments of
God, and continue to despise the order of heaven, I will pray
that the curse of the Almighty may be close to their heels, and
that it may be following them all the day long. And those
that enter into it (the celestial order) and are faithful, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
promise them that they shall be queens in heaven and rulers
to all eternity.</p>

<p>“Now if any of you will deny the plurality of wives, and
continue to do so, I promise that you will be damned.”</p>

<p>This was sweet language for a Prophet and a Saint to utter,
and yet it is not half so coarse or improper as some whole sermons
that I have listened to from the lips of Brother Brigham
and the other leaders of the Church.</p>

<p>The Apostle Orson Pratt is the only one who has dared, in
the presence of Brigham, to say that education was a proper
thing, and that there were many books which would be of good
service to the Saints, if they obtained and studied them. On
one occasion, Brigham arose in ire, and said,—</p>

<p>“The professor has told you that there are many books in
the world, and I tell you that there are many people there.
He says there is something in all these books; I say each of
those persons has got a name. It would do you just as much
good to learn those somebodies’ names as it would to read
those books. Five minutes’ revelation would teach me more
truth than all this pack of nonsense that I should have packed
away in my unlucky brains from books.”</p>

<p>But the Prophet has changed with the times, and there
are now in Utah very good schools, both Mormon and
Gentile, but none of them are <em>free</em>-schools. Bishop Taylor
once said in a public lecture that they were “destructive to
the best interests of the community;” and the bishop’s
“lord” in the Lion-House is exactly of the same opinion, for
he has repeatedly declared that “there <em>shall be no</em> ‘free-schools’
within his Saintly ‘Kingdom’ on earth.” Nevertheless,
Brother Brigham and his “<em>Infallible</em> Priesthood” are at
last beginning to discover that although the night of ignorance
and superstition may hate the clear daylight of truth
and knowledge, when the great Ruler of all commands the
light to come forth it is not in the power of man, with all his
boasting, to forbid the sun to shine upon the dark places of the
earth.</p>

<p>Balls, parties, and the theatre provided amusement for the
people in Salt Lake City itself; but in the Settlements there
was little else in the shape of recreation than idle gossip or
the harangues of the Tabernacle.</p>

<p>At the time when we went to Utah, Mormon society was
slowly recovering from that terrible marrying mania which
had set in during the “Reformation,” and a season of divorce
was the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The authorities at that time, as I have already observed, had
urged every person, without distinction, into Polygamy. Men
and women had been forced to marry one another without any
respect to affection or fitness, and the result was that hundreds
of marriages were entered into which made those who contracted
them miserable for life, but the consequences of which
they could not avoid. At the same time not a few were
divorced almost immediately after they were married, and
these things were a matter of daily occurrence. Brigham
Young, with his eye perpetually on the dollar, finding that
his marrying scheme, like many other of his “divine” plans,
was a failure, saw at once that quite a nice little sum might be
realized by charging a fee for divorces. Nothing was charged
for marrying; but if the people insisted on having divorces,
why, the best, and certainly the most profitable thing, was to
make them pay for them. When we first went to Utah, the
Prophet was doing quite a flourishing business in that line.
Any one could get a divorce for ten dollars; and Brigham
publicly in the Tabernacle jested about it, and said that the
money thus obtained came in very conveniently as pin-money
for his wives, though I doubt if they ever received a dollar of
it. He added, that so far as “eternity” was concerned, these
divorces were not worth the paper they were written on; the
people had married for eternity, and in eternity they would
have to live together, whether they liked it or not. He says
the same to-day; but still he sells his divorces, and gathers in
the ten dollars.</p>

<p>As I have written so much of the troubles of the sisters,
perhaps it will be as well to give the reader an idea of the
trials and difficulties which the brethren had to contend with
when they first attempted the introduction of Polygamy. To
do this, I shall give the correspondence of Miss Martha
Brotherton, formerly of Manchester, England, relating to a
very interesting courtship between herself and Brigham
Young. I would have the reader remark that this correspondence
distinctly proves that Polygamy was taught by the heads
of the church <em>before</em> the Prophet received the professed revelation.</p>

<p>This account was published just a year, lacking one day,
before the revelation on Polygamy was given to Joseph Smith.
It was published in Boston, in book form, in 1842. The revelation
was given at Nauvoo, on the 12th of July 1843.</p>

<p>The following is the letter referred to:<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, Missouri, July 13, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1842.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—I left Warsaw a short time since for this
city, and having been called upon by you, through the <cite>Sangamo
Journal</cite>, to come out and disclose to the world the facts of the
case in relation to certain propositions made to me, at Nauvoo,
by some of the Mormon leaders, I now proceed to respond to
the call, and discharge what I consider to be a duty devolving
upon me as an innocent, but insulted and abused female. I
had been at Nauvoo nearly three weeks, during which time
my father’s family received frequent visits from Elders
Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, two of the Mormon
Apostles; when, early one morning, they both came to my
brother-in-law’s (John McIlwrick’s) house, at which place I
was then on a visit, and particularly requested me to go and
spend a few days with them. I told them I could not at that
time, as my brother-in-law was not at home; however, they
urged me to go the next day and spend one day with them.
The day being fine, I accordingly went. When I arrived at
the foot of the hill, Young and Kimball were standing conversing
together. They both came to me, and after several
flattering compliments, Kimball wished me to go to his house
first. I said it was immaterial to me, and went accordingly.
We had not, however, gone many steps when Young suddenly
stopped, and said he would go to that brother’s (pointing to a
little log hut a few yards distant), and tell him that you
(speaking to Kimball) and Brother Glover, or Grover (I do
not remember which) will value his land. When he had
gone, Kimball turned to me and said, ‘Martha, I want you to
say to my wife, when you go to my house, that you want to
buy some things at Joseph’s store (Joseph Smith’s), and I
will say I am going with you to show you the way. You
know you want to see the Prophet, and you will then have
an opportunity.’ I made no reply. Young again made his
appearance, and the subject was dropped. We soon reached
Kimball’s house, when Young took his leave, saying, ‘I shall
see you again, Martha.’ I remained at Kimball’s nearly an
hour; when Kimball, seeing I would not tell the lies he
wished me to, told them to his wife himself. He then went
and whispered in her ear, and asked if that would please her.
‘Yes,’ she said, ‘or I can go along with you and Martha.’
‘No,’ said he, ‘I have some business to do, and I will call for
you afterwards to go with me to the debate,’ meaning the
debate between yourself and Joseph. To this she consented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
So Kimball and I went to the store together. As we were
going along, he said, ‘Sister Martha, are you willing to
do all that the Prophet requires you to do?’ I said, I believed
I was—thinking, of course, he would require nothing wrong.
‘Then,’ said he, ‘are you ready to take counsel?’ I answered
in the affirmative, thinking of the great and glorious blessings
that had been pronounced upon my head if I adhered to the
counsel of those placed over me in the Lord. ‘Well,’ said he
‘there are many things revealed in these last days that the
world would laugh and scoff at; but unto us is given to know
the mysteries of the kingdom.’ He further observed, ‘Martha,
you must learn to hold your tongue, and it will be well with
you. You will see Joseph, and very likely will have some
conversation with him, and he will tell you what you shall do.’
When we reached the building, he led me up some stairs to a
small room, the door of which was locked, and on it the following
inscription, ‘Positively no admittance.’ He observed,
‘Ah! Brother Joseph must be sick, for, strange to say, he is
not here. Come down into the tithing-office, Martha.’ He
then left me in the tithing-office and went out, I know not
where. In this office were two men writing, one of whom,
William Clayton, I had seen in England; the other I did not
know. Young came in and seated himself before me, and
asked where Kimball was. I said he had gone out. He said
it was all right. Soon after, Joseph came in and spoke to one
of the clerks, and then went upstairs, followed by Young.
Immediately after, Kimball came in. ‘Now Martha,’ said he,
‘the Prophet has come; come upstairs.’ I went, and we
found Young and the Prophet alone. I was introduced to the
Prophet by Young. Joseph offered me his seat, and, to my
astonishment, the moment I was seated, Joseph and Kimball
walked out of the room, and left me with Young, who arose,
locked the door, closed the window, and drew the curtain. He
then came and sat before me and said, ‘This is our private
room, Martha.’ ‘Indeed, sir,’ said I; ‘I must be highly
honoured to be permitted to enter it.’ He smiled, and then
proceeded, ‘Sister Martha, I want to ask you a few questions;
will you answer them?’ ‘Yes, sir,’ said I. ‘And will you
promise me not to mention them to any one?’ ‘If it is your
desire, sir,’ said I, ‘I will not.’ ‘And you will not think any
the worse of me for it; will you, Martha?’ said he. ‘No,
sir,’ I replied. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘what are your feelings toward
me?’ I replied, ‘My feelings are just the same toward
you that they ever were, sir.’ ‘But, to come to the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
more closely,’ said he, ‘have not you an affection for me,
that, were it lawful and right, you would accept of me for your
husband and companion?’ My feelings at this moment were
indescribable. God only knows them. What, thought I, are
these men, that I thought almost perfection itself, deceivers,
and is all my fancied happiness but a dream? ’Twas even
so; but my next thought was, which is the best way for me
to act at this time? If I say <em>No</em>, they may do as they think
proper; and to say <em>Yes</em>, I never would. So I considered it
best to ask for time to think and pray about it. I therefore
said, ‘If it was lawful and right, perhaps I might; but you
know, sir, it is not.’ ‘Well, but,’ said he, ‘Brother Joseph has
had a revelation from God that it is lawful and right for a
man to have two wives; for, as it was in the days of Abraham,
so it shall be in these last days, and whoever is the first
that is willing to take up the cross will receive the greatest
blessings; and, if you will accept of me, I will take you
straight to the celestial kingdom; and, if you will have me in
this world, I will have you in that which is to come, and
Brother Joseph will marry us here, to-day, and you can go
home this evening, and your parents will not know anything
about it.’ ‘Sir,’ said I, ‘I should not like to do anything of
the kind without the permission of my parents.’ ‘Well, but,’
said he, ‘you are of age, are you not?’ ‘No, sir,’ said I; ‘I
shall not be until the 24th of May.’ ‘Well,’ said he, ‘that
does not make any difference. You will be of age before they
know, and you need not fear. If you will take my counsel, it
will be well with you, for I know it to be right before God;
and if there is any sin in it, I will answer for it. But Brother
Joseph wishes to have some talk with you on the subject; he
will explain things; will you hear him?’ ‘I do not mind,’
said I. ‘Well, but I want you to say something,’ said he.
‘I want to think about it,’ said I. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘I will
have a kiss, anyhow,’ and then rose, and said he would bring
Joseph. He then unlocked the door, and took the key, and
locked me up alone. He was absent about ten minutes, and
then returned with Joseph. ‘Well,’ said Young, ‘Sister
Martha would be willing if she knew it was lawful and right
before God.’ ‘Well, Martha,’ said Joseph, ‘it is lawful
and right before God—I <em>know</em> it is. Look here, sis; don’t
you believe in me.’ I did not answer. ‘Well, Martha,’ said
Joseph, ‘just go ahead, and do as Brigham wants you to; he
is the best man in the world, except me.’ ‘Oh!’ said
Brigham, ‘then you are as good.’ ‘Yes,’ said Joseph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
‘Well,’ said Young, ‘we believe Joseph to be a Prophet. I
have known him near eight years, and have always found him
the same.’ ‘Yes,’ said Joseph, ‘and I know that this is lawful
and right before God, and if there is any sin in it, I will answer
for it before God; and I have the keys of the kingdom, and
whatever I bind on earth is bound in heaven, and whatever I
loose on earth is loosed in heaven; and if you will accept of
Brigham, you shall be blessed—God shall bless you, and my
blessing shall rest upon you; and, if you will be led by him,
you will do well; for I know that Brigham will do well by you,
and if he don’t do his duty to you, come to me, and I will make
him; and if you do not like it in a month or two, come to me
and I will make you free again; and if he turns you off, I
will take you on.’ ‘Sir,’ said I, rather warmly, ‘it will be too
late to think in a month or two after. I want time to think
first.’ ‘Well, but,’ said he, ‘the old proverb is, “Nothing
ventured, nothing gained,” and it will be the greatest blessing
that was ever bestowed upon you.’ ‘Yes,’ said Young, ‘and
you will never have reason to repent it—that is, if I do not
turn from righteousness, and that, I trust, I never shall; for I
believe God, who has kept me so long, will continue to keep
me faithful. Did you ever see me act in any way wrong in England,
Martha?’ ‘No, sir,’ said I. ‘No,’ said he; ‘neither
can any one else lay anything to my charge.’ ‘Well, then,’
said Joseph, ‘what are you afraid of, sis? Come, let me do
the business for you.’ ‘Sir,’ said I, ‘do let me have a little
time to think about it, and I will promise not to mention it to
any one.’ ‘Well, but look here,’ said he; ‘you know a fellow
will never be damned for doing the best he knows how.’
‘Well, then,’ said I, ‘the best way I know of is, to go home
and think and pray about it.’ ‘Well,’ said Young, ‘I shall leave
it with Brother Joseph, whether it would be best for you to have
time or not.’ ‘Well,’ said Joseph, ‘I see no harm in her having
time to think, if she will not fall into temptation.’ ‘Oh
sir!’ said I, ‘there is no fear of my falling into temptation.’
‘Well, but,’ said Brigham, ‘you must promise me you will never
mention it to any one.’ ‘I do promise it,’ said I. ‘Well,’ said
Joseph, ‘you must promise me the same.’ I promised him the
same. ‘Upon your honour,’ said he, ‘you will not tell.’
‘No, sir; I will lose my life first,’ said I. ‘Well, that will
do,’ said he; ‘that is the principle we go upon. I think
I can trust you, Martha,’ said he. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘I think
you ought.’ Joseph said, ‘She looks as if she could keep
a secret.’ I then rose to go, when Joseph commenced to beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of me again. He said it was the best opportunity they might
have for months, for the room was often engaged. I, however,
had determined what to do. ‘Well,’ said Young, ‘I
will see you to-morrow. I am going to preach at the school-house
opposite your house. I have never preached there yet;
you will be there, I suppose.’ ‘Yes,’ said I. The next day
being Sunday, I sat down, instead of going to meeting, and
wrote the conversation, and gave it to my sister, who was not
a little surprised; but she said it would be best to go to the
meeting in the afternoon. We went, and Young administered
the sacrament. After it was over, I was passing out, and
Young stopped me, saying, ‘Wait, Martha; I am coming.’ I
said, ‘I cannot; my sister is waiting for me.’ He then threw
his coat over his shoulders, and followed me out, and whispered,
‘Have you made up your mind, Martha?’ ‘Not exactly, sir,’
said I; and we parted. I shall proceed to a justice of the
peace, and make oath to the truth of these statements, and
you are at liberty to make what use of them you may think
best.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORIGIN OF “THE REFORMATION:”—EXTRAORDINARY
DOINGS OF THE SAINTS.</span></h2>

<p>The popular idea of Mormonism is that the peculiar feature
which distinguishes it from all other Christian sects is Polygamy.
To a certain extent this is, of course, true; but it is only
a partial statement of the truth. If Polygamy were to be
relinquished, it would still be found that Mormonism had really
very little in common with other sects, and very much that
was completely antagonistic to them.</p>

<p>The confession of faith published by Joseph Smith during
his lifetime would certainly deceive an uninitiated person;
and it was in consequence of the ambiguity of that very document
that so many unsuspecting persons were from the beginning
of Mormonism led astray by the teachings of the Missionaries.
The convert was told that the Mormon faith proclaimed
the existence of one true God, but he was not told that
Father Adam was that deity, and that he is “like a well-to-do
farmer.” He was told that Christ was the Son of God, but
he was not taught that the Virgin Mary was “the lawful wife
of God the Father,” and that “He intended after the resurrection
to take her again, as one of His own wives, to raise up
immortal spirits in eternity. He was told of faith in a Saviour,
he was not told that men were the only saviours of their
wives, and that unless a woman pleased her husband, and was
obedient and was saved <em>by him</em>, she could not be saved at all.
He was told that the Saints believed in the Holy Ghost, but
he was not told that “The Holy Ghost is a man; he is one
of the sons of our Father and our God.... You think our
Father and our God is not a lively, sociable, and cheerful
man; He is one of the most lively men that ever lived!”</p>

<p>And yet, although such fearful and shocking blasphemy
was, of course, hidden from the convert whom it was desirable
to impress with the idea that Mormonism was only a development
of Christianity, it was openly taught in the sermons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the Tabernacle before thousands of people, and inculcated in
the writings of the highest authorities. The passages which
I have just quoted, were preached in public, were taken down
in shorthand were revised under the superintendence of
Brigham Young or one of the chief leaders, were then printed
and published in Salt Lake City, and afterwards reprinted in
another form.</p>

<p>The verbal repetition of such blasphemy as this would be
simply painful and disgusting to any right-minded person. I
shall therefore endeavour to give an idea of some of these
outrageous doctrines without entering too closely into details.
Should the reader, however, wish to search and see for him
self, I refer him to the <cite>Journals of Discourses</cite>, the files of the
Church papers, and the publications of the Mormon writers
generally.</p>

<p>One of the first innovations upon the received faith of
ordinary Christians was the doctrine of Polytheism. There
can be no doubt that, even in Joseph’s time, that doctrine was
taught, although, as in the case of Polygamy, all knowledge
of it was kept from every one but the initiated—the “strong
men” who could be entrusted with the inner secrets of the
church leaders. That such a doctrine, however, was beginning,
even then, to form part of the faith of the Saints, may
be seen in the following lines upon the occasion of the Prophet’s
murder:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Unchanged in death, with a <em>Saviour’s</em> love,</div>
<div class="verse">He pleads their cause in the courts above.</div>
<div class="verse">His home’s in the sky, <em>he dwells with the Gods</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">Far from the furious rage of mobs!</div>
<div class="verse">...</div>
<div class="verse">He died! he died for those he loved;</div>
<div class="verse"><em>He reigns!</em> <em>He reigns</em> in the realms above.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many other instances, even stronger than this, could easily
be given.</p>

<p>The Mormon idea of the other world, while in some respects
it differed from the teachings of certain modern “Spiritualists,”
was not altogether dissimilar. The soul was said to be immortal,
and it had three stages of existence. The first was
purely spiritual—the state of the soul <em>before</em> it came into this
world. Spirits in that condition were not perfect, they must
first take a fleshly body, and pass through the trials of life,
before they could attain to the highest state of existence.
Hence it was a solemn duty, as well as their highest privilege,
for men to practise polygamy:—their duty, as by this means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and by this alone, the yet imperfect souls now waiting to
come into this world could ever hope to be admitted into the
“Celestial Kingdom;”—and a privilege,—as all the souls
whom they thus assisted to emigrate would form their own
“Kingdoms” in eternity, over which, as kings and priests, they
would reign for ever and ever.</p>

<p>The second stage of the soul’s existence is the mortal; with
which we all are sadly well acquainted. The third is the condition
subsequent to the Resurrection, when they believe the
flesh and bones will form the raised body, but the blood will
not be there; for the blood is the principle of corrupt life, and
therefore another spirit supplies its place in heaven. That
Christ partook of some broiled fish and part of a honeycomb is
evident from Holy Scripture; the Mormons therefore teach
that heaven will be very much the same as earth, only considerably
improved. We shall not marry there or be given
in marriage; hence it is necessary for us to marry here, and
to marry as much as we can, for then in heaven a man will
take the wives whom he married on earth, or who have been
sealed to him by proxy; they will be his queens, and their
children will be his subjects. We shall eat, and drink, and
feast, and spend a happy time generally. We shall henceforth
never die; hence we shall ourselves be gods!</p>

<p>It was in the pre-existent state, the Mormons teach, that
the work of salvation was first planned; but not after the
fashion believed by all Christians. A grand celestial council
was held, at which all the Sons of God appeared. Michael,
the father of all, presided, and stated that he proposed to
create a new world, of which he proceeded to give some
details. His first begotten then arose, and made a speech, in
which he proposed that Michael, his father, should go down to
the world, when created, with Eve, his mother, and do there
much after the fashion of what is related of our first parents
in the Book of Genesis; he himself would descend some
thousands of years subsequently, and would lead his erring
brethren back, and save them <em>from</em> their sins. Lucifer, the
second son, then stood forth and unfolded <em>his</em> plan. Jealous
of the popularity of his elder brother, he proposed to save men
<em>in</em> their sins.</p>

<p>Great discussion ensued, in which the unnumbered family
of heaven divided into three parties; one under each of the
two elder sons, and the third standing neutral. After a terrible
conflict, Lucifer, the second son, was defeated, and, with
all his followers, was driven out of heaven. They descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
into the abyss, where they founded the infernal kingdom, of
which Lucifer became the chief. He was henceforth known
as the Devil. Adam created his world, and carried out his
part of the plan; and in due time the eldest son, who conquered
in heaven, took upon him the form of flesh, dwelt
among men, and was known as their Redeemer. The spirits
who stood neutral during the fight subsequently took upon
them forms of flesh, entering into the children of Ham, and
were known as negroes. Therefore it is, that although the
American Indians and all other races are eligible for the Mormon
priesthood, the negro alone could never attain to that high
dignity.</p>

<p>On the 9th of April, 1852, Brigham Young publicly
announced that,—</p>

<p>“When our father Adam came into the Garden of Eden,
he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one
of his wives, with him. He helped to make and organize this
world. He is Michael the Archangel, the Ancient of Days,
about whom holy men have written and spoken. He is our
‘Father and our God,’ and the only god with whom we have
to do.”</p>

<p>This public declaration gave great offence, and led to the
apostacy of many. Nevertheless, Brigham Young thinks that
just as Adam came down to Eden and subsequently became
a god, in like manner he also himself will attain to the godhead.
Heber C. Kimball, zealous to go a step further, declared
that Brigham <em>was</em> “God,” and that he, Kimball, stood toward
him in the same relation as the Third Person in the Blessed
Trinity does towards the First.</p>

<p>It will hence be seen that subordination is one of the first
principles of the Mormon faith, and this even in the Church
organization of the Saints has been distinctively shown. For
the purposes for which it exists the Mormon hierarchy could
not be surpassed. Of the Priesthood there are two orders—the
Melchisedec and the Aaronic; of which the former ranks
first and highest. The lowest rank in the Church is the
“Deacon;” he looks after the places of meeting, takes up
collections, and attends to other similar duties. Next comes
the “Teacher.” He visits the Saints and takes note of their
standing, and reports the same: weakness of faith, or backwardness
in paying tithing, is never overlooked by him. After
him is the “Priest,” and above him is the Elder whose office
it is to preach, baptize, and lay on hands. All these belong
to the order of the Aaronic—or the Levitical priesthood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
“Bishops” are simply Church officers having local
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The lowest grade in the Melchisedec Priesthood is the
“Elder.” He administers in all the ordinances of the Church.
Above him there is no higher rank as respects the priesthood,
but in respect to office there are various gradations, as, for
example, the “High Priests,” the “Seventies,” and “Bishops,”
who occupy positions of authority, although both go on missions,
and also the Apostles. The “Apostles” were chosen in
imitation of the “Twelve” appointed by Christ; and in the
same way the “Seventies,” in imitation of the <em>seventy</em> disciples
sent forth to preach and work miracles. They claim rank
next to the Twelve. The “Quorum of the Apostles” is presided
over by the eldest of their number; the “Quorums of
Seventies” are each composed of seventy Elders with a “President”
and six “Counsellors.” The number of “quorums”
is unlimited; and over them all collectively is another president
and six counsellors.</p>

<p>The highest authority in the Church is the “First Presidency;”
the three members of which at present are Brigham
Young, George A. Smith, and Daniel H. Wells,—who are
said to represent on earth the three Persons of the Blessed
Trinity!</p>

<p>As, from “President” Young down to the most illiterate
“Elder,” every one is supposed to be specially inspired, and
to be immediately guided by the gift of the Holy Ghost,
education is utterly unnecessary to the members of the Mormon
priesthood; in fact, it has always been looked upon as an
impediment to its possessor. <em>Obedience</em> is considered the
highest qualification, and it was the strict enforcement of
obedience on the part of the ordinary people and the lower
grades of the priesthood towards the higher that alone could
have made possible that state of affairs which existed during
the “Reformation.” Hence also it is that Brigham Young
and the leaders are rightly held responsible for the deeds of
violence and fanaticism which their followers may perpetrate;
for it is well known that <em>no</em> Mormon, in a matter of grave
importance, would dare to act upon his own responsibility, and
without he felt sure that what he did would meet with the
approbation of those in authority.</p>

<p>There is another class of Church officer which I had very
nearly forgotten—the Patriarchs. The chief of these is called
“The Presiding Patriarch <em>over</em> the Church;” the rest are
“Patriarchs <em>in</em> the Church.” The office of these dignitaries is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to bless the people and to be paid for their blessings. The
price of good blessings is variable. Not long ago, when money
was scarce and payments were made in produce, two dollars
was considered reasonable; and if several were wanted for
the same family, a reduction was made. Hyrum Smith, the
original Prophet’s eldest brother, was the first Patriarch; and
to him succeeded “Uncle John,” as he was popularly called,
the eldest brother of Brigham. The present Patriarch is the
son of Hyrum; still a young man, who obtained his office by
inheritance—and this, I believe, is about the only office in the
Church which Brother Brigham has permitted the Smith family
to inherit or enjoy.</p>

<p>The idea of reviving the old Jewish polity was always uppermost
in the minds of the Mormons. Hence they revived the
Priesthood and High-priesthood in their various forms; a magnificent
temple was built in Nauvoo, just as another temple is
now being erected at Salt Lake City; and so far did they go
that it was even determined that the ancient sacrifices should
eventually be restored.</p>

<p>It is alleged that in Nauvoo, among the Mormons, a secret
body of men had been chosen, who were enrolled, under the
most frightful oaths, to avenge every wrong which might be
perpetrated against the Saints. This band was said to have
originated with Sidney Rigdon and Dr. Sampson Avard, and,
as I have somewhere else mentioned, Thomas B. Marsh and
Hyde the present chief of the Apostles both made affidavit that
such was the case, and that the band was sworn to commit the
most shocking acts of vengeance,—and surely Marsh and
Hyde ought to know. Various names were chosen for this
“death society.” First the members were called Daughters
of Zion [<i>from</i> Micah iv. 13]. But as it sounded rather
ridiculous to speak of bearded ruffians as “daughters,” that
name was abandoned, and the title “Avenging Angels” substituted;
and that, with some other names then temporarily
used, were subsequently dropped for the name “Danites” [<i>from</i>
Genesis xlix. 17], which has since been retained;—not by the
Mormons, for they have ever denied the existence of any such
band, but by the Gentiles.</p>

<p>It matters very little what the name of such a society might
be, so long as it existed at all; and that it does, and has, existed
in <em>some</em> form cannot reasonably be denied. There probably
is not at the present time any formally enrolled society,
but it is quite certain that for many years past if “The
Church” had only dropped a hint that any man’s blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
ought to be shed, that man would have had a very short
tenure of his life. Even Brigham himself said publicly:</p>

<p>“If men come here and do not behave themselves, they will
not only find the Danites, whom they talk so much about,
biting the horses’ heels, but the scoundrels will find something
biting <em>their</em> heels. In my plain remarks I simply call things by
their own names.”</p>

<p>It is beyond a doubt that, notwithstanding all the social
changes and improvements of late years, the secret police of
Salt Lake City are in matters of crime, as well as <em>in fact</em>,
though not perhaps nominally, the successors of the original
“death society;”—many of its members are known to have
committed grievous crimes and to have repeatedly dyed their
hands in blood. The shocking deeds that every now and then
are divulged to the world are all of their doing, and no resident
of Salt Lake City, whether Mormon or Gentile, although
he might prudently decline to state his opinions, would in his
mind question the fact that it is fear of consequences, and only
because the Saints are “on their good behaviour” in the sight
of the Federal Government, that the hands of these wretches
are withheld from a continuance of their old enormities.</p>

<p>As might be supposed, the establishment of a secret band
of men professedly ready at a moment to steal, to shed blood,
or commit any crime at the command of their leaders, created
great excitement in the whole State of Missouri, and especially
in the vicinity of the Mormon Settlements.</p>

<p>Like the Ishmaelites of old, the hands of the Saints were
against every man, and every man’s hand was against them.
They were taught that they were “a chosen nation, a royal
priesthood, a peculiar people”—the “Sword of the Lord and
of Gideon” was to be theirs; they were to go forth conquering
and to conquer; and the Gentiles were to be trodden down
beneath their feet.</p>

<p>As might be expected, trouble immediately arose; the people
of Missouri outraged the Mormons, and the Mormons in return
outraged them. Murders, thefts, and the most shameful
atrocities were of daily occurrence, and the history of those
terrible doings would fill a good-sized volume. Suffice it to say,
that the excitement continued and increased, reprisals being
made on both sides; finally the mob was triumphant, and after
committing many fearful excesses it was organized into a
militia—the leading men in authority declaring that the Mormons
must either leave the State or else they must be extirpated
by the sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, the Mormons, at all times an
industrious people, were in one sense successful and prosperous;
the morality, however, of some of their leading men
was to say the least very questionable. It was openly argued
that the silver and gold were the Lord’s, and so were the cattle
on a thousand hills. The Scripture says that God has given
His people all things richly to enjoy. The Saints were the
people of God:—He had given <em>them</em> all the wealth and substance
of the earth, and therefore it was no sin for them to help
themselves; they were but taking their own. To overreach
or defraud their enemies was facetiously called by the Mormons
“milking the Gentiles.”</p>

<p>Their city called Nauvoo—The Beautiful,—a name given by
the Prophet Joseph and supposed to be of celestial origin, was
well laid out and well built, a costly Temple was nearly complete,
and the leaders, at least, began to show signs of wealth
and prosperity. This however was but a lull before the storm.
Writs upon various charges against Joseph and the leading
Elders had always been floating about, and the serving of some
of the later ones had only been prevented by technical difficulties
or the personal fears of the Sheriff. To enter Nauvoo
for the purpose of arresting the Prophet was like bearding
the lion in his den; for by this time a splendidly equipped
and drilled militia regiments under the name of Nauvoo
Legion had been organized, and Joseph had been elected
Lieutenant-General. The regiment consisted solely of well-tried
Mormons who were devotedly attached to their leader;
besides which, the whole of the population of the city was at
his call at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>Into the city of the Saints, as far as was possible to prevent
it, no Gentile was allowed to intrude. It was at risk of life
and property that any one ventured. One oddly original mode
of driving out the devoted stranger is worthy of mention—it
was called “<em>whittling</em> a man out of the town!” Opposite
the victim’s door a number of men and overgrown boys would
take up their quarters, each armed with a stout stick of wood
and a huge knife. No sooner did the Gentile appear than
the whole horde gathered in a circle round him. Not a word
was uttered, but each man grasping firmly his stick in his
left hand, pointed its other end to within a few inches of the
victim’s face, while with the knife in his right hand he sliced
a shaving out of the wood in such a way as to bring the
point of the knife almost against the face of the unfortunate
man. Wherever he turned they attended him, always preserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the strictest silence, and never actually touching him.
The intolerable sensation caused by the “whittling” of this
strange body-guard, who were in attendance day and night,
and the unpleasantness of seeing half a score of sharp knives
flashing perpetually within an inch of his nose, generally subdued
the strongest-minded Gentile;—few could endure it for
more than a day or so at the utmost: they were glad to leave—“<em>Whittled
out</em> of the town!”</p>

<p>The evil day, however, at last came. The Prophet, fearing
arrest, fled, but was persuaded to return and deliver
himself up. The charge against him was one for which
reasonable bail could be taken; bail was offered, accepted,
and the prisoners discharged. Before leaving court, however,
the Prophet and his brother Hyrum, the Patriarch, were
arrested upon a trumped-up charge of treason, a charge for
which it was impossible that bail should be taken; they
were therefore committed to custody in Carthage jail, under
solemn promise from Governor Ford of Illinois that the
State should be answerable for their personal protection.
The same day, however, a mob of over one hundred men,
assisted, it is said, by the militia who were left in charge, burst
into the jail and assassinated the Prophet and his brother.</p>

<p>As might be supposed, this outrage by no means weakened
the Mormon cause; their Prophet was now a martyr, and his
name became more powerful after death than it could possibly
have been had he lived. It was, however, clearer than ever
that nothing could now reconcile the people of Illinois to the
Mormons, and the latter seriously began to think of leaving
that State in a body as they had formerly left Missouri.</p>

<p>The terrible doings of those times I have no idea of relating
just now; I simply allude to them in order that the
reader may understand how, in the excitement produced in
that border-warfare, it was possible for such strange events as
afterwards transpired in Utah to originate. I may simply add,
that the Temple being completed, and the first “Endowments”
given there, the people gathered up what little
property they could rescue from the mob, and under the
guidance of Brigham Young, and amidst privations, sufferings,
and outrages of the most painful character, left the city
which they had founded in Illinois, and set out for the Rocky
Mountains, where, beside the Great Salt Lake, they founded
their modern Zion.</p>

<p>Free now from the violence of mobs and Gentile enmity, it
might have been supposed that the hatred which had so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
been part of the Mormon faith would have died a natural
death. The contrary, however, was the case. The Mexican
war was then raging, and, <i lang="fr">en route</i> to the Rocky Mountains,
the Mormons had received a proposal from the Federal
Government that they should supply a regiment, upon highly
advantageous conditions, to join the United States troops
which were then operating in California. This suggestion
was kindly made, for it was thought that the Mormon regiment
thus raised would in reality be only marching their own
way in going to California, and that the outfits, pay, arms, &amp;c.,
which were to be theirs, after the year for which they were
enrolled had expired, would be of essential service to them.
It was like paying men liberally for making a journey for
their own benefit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, Brigham Young and the leaders
represented the transaction in quite another light, and the
people were taught that an engagement, into which they had
entered of their own free will, and from which they had derived
substantial advantages, was an act of heartless cruelty
and despotic tyranny on the part of the Government. This
feeling was fostered, until at length the Saints as a body
regarded themselves as a wronged and outraged people, and
considered every Gentile, in fact the whole nation, as their
natural enemies. This was perhaps all the more singular,
since, after the vast tract of country, of which Utah forms a
part, had, at the end of the war, been wrested from Mexico,
Brigham Young had been appointed by President Millard
Fillmore the first Governor and Indian Agent of the territory;
he was therefore in Federal pay, and bound, as long as he retained
office, to support the Government, or at the very least
not to stir up disaffection.</p>

<p>Trouble soon arose between Governor Young and the
Mormons on one side and the Judges and United States
courts and officials on the other. Once an armed mob burst
into the Supreme Court, and forced the Judge then sitting to
adjourn; at another time a <em>bonfire</em> was made of the books and
papers of the District Courts; then a Judge on the bench
was threatened with personal outrage; and subsequently a
<i lang="la">posse</i> summoned by legal(!) process “encamped” for a whole
fortnight over against another <i lang="la">posse</i> summoned without legal
process, the two bodies burning with bitter hatred and breathing
out threatenings and slaughter. Such a state of affairs
could not, of course, last long. On the one side the wildest
statements were publicly made against the Government;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
threats which, uttered by a little band of pioneers against a
mighty nation, were perfectly ridiculous, stirred up the hearts
of the Saints. On the other hand it was pretty certain that
Federal troops would have to be sent out to Utah to preserve
the peace of the Territory. The Federal Government was
nevertheless defied, abused, and derided, and the people,
thoroughly blinded by their fanaticism, did not for a moment
doubt that, should Governor Young “declare war,” the United
States troops would vanish before the “Armies” of the Saints
like chaff upon the threshing-floor. So absurd does all this
appear that I should really hardly venture to repeat it were it
not that every one in Utah—Mormon and Gentile—knows
that I am really understating facts rather than otherwise.
Very soon came a crisis in Mormon history, for which all the
wild sayings and unlawful doings had been so long paving the
way:—“<span class="smcap">The Reformation</span>” was destined to be the crowning
point of Saintly folly and Saintly sin.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE “REIGN OF TERROR” IN UTAH:—THE REFORMATION OF
THE SAINTS.</span></h2>

<p>The people were now thoroughly excited. Their religious
antipathy, their political hatred—two of the most powerful
passions which move individuals or bodies of men—had been
appealed to, and both in public and private they had been
stirred up to a pitch of frenzy which it is hardly possible at
the present time to comprehend.</p>

<p>There were whisperings now of a most fearful doctrine,
calculated not only to strike terror into the hearts of those
whose faith was weakening, but even to shock with a sense
of horror those who only heard of it from afar—I mean the
doctrine of the <span class="smcap">Blood Atonement</span>.</p>

<p>The Saints had all along been taught to distinguish between
murder and the shedding of innocent blood—the former being
spoken of as a crime for which atonement might be made, but
for the latter there was no repentance on earth—it was an
unpardonable sin. They were also taught to distinguish
carefully between sins which might be forgiven, and sins for
which pardon was impossible. Now the difference between
murder and shedding innocent blood is this:—the latter is the
crime of killing a Saint, which can never be forgiven, but by
the death of the transgressor; but the former is of quite a
different character. To murder a Gentile may sometimes be
inexpedient, or perhaps even to a certain extent wrong, but it
is seldom if ever a crime, and never an unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was in a state of apostacy. The Bishop
went to her to expostulate, and told her that, if he were her
husband, he would get rid of her and take away her children
as well—he would not on any account live with her.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said, “you would not allow me to live at
all?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” he replied. “I would think about as much
of killing you or any other miserable Apostate as I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
about killing a cat. If Brigham Young were to tell me to put
you to death, I would do it with the greatest of pleasure;—and
it would be for your good, too.”</p>

<p>Thus, when the famous Revelation on Polygamy says that
a man cannot be pardoned for shedding innocent blood, it does
not mean that he cannot be pardoned for murdering a Gentile
or an Apostate; for that, under some circumstances, might
even be meritorious; but that the murder of a Saint by one of
the brethren cannot under <em>any</em> circumstances be forgiven on
earth, and that his only chance of forgiveness lies in his own
blood being shed as an “atonement.”</p>

<p>Certain sins cannot be forgiven here on earth—shedding
innocent blood, divulging the secrets of the Endowment
House—marital unfaithfulness on the part of the wife—Apostacy;—these
are unpardonable. All other crimes which
Gentiles abhor may become even virtues, if done in the cause
of the Church. I do not, of course, mean to say that the mass
of the Mormon people act up to such atrocious doctrines; for
although, when among themselves, they would admit that the
theory was correct, the better instincts of their nature keep
them from ever putting that theory into practice. But what
I do mean to say is, that such doctrines have, over and over
again, been distinctly taught in the plainest words in the public
hearing of thousands; that they <em>have</em> been printed and reprinted
by authority; that they have been practised, and the
very highest of the Mormon leaders have applauded; and that,
even at the present moment, these doctrines form part of the
dogmas of the Church. It is this day a matter of fact, and
not a matter of question, that if any Mormon Apostate were
to commit any of the unpardonable sins which I have mentioned,
and if he or she were to be assassinated by a private
individual, all zealous Mormons—all the leaders—would
maintain that not only was the deed justifiable but even
meritorious!</p>

<p>This may seem bad enough, but it is not the worst. The
doctrine of the “<span class="smcap">Blood Atonement</span>” is that the murder of
an Apostate is <em>a deed of love</em>! If a Saint sees another leave
the Church, or if even he only believes that his brother’s faith
is weakening and that he will apostatize before long, he knows
that the soul of his unbelieving brother will be lost if he dies
in such a state, and that only by his blood being shed is there
any chance of forgiveness for him; it is therefore the kindest
action that he can perform toward him to shed his blood—the
doing so is a deed of truest love. The nearer, the dearer, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
more tenderly loved the sinner is, the greater the affection
shown by the shedder of blood—the action is no longer murder
or the shedding of innocent blood, for the taint of apostacy
takes away its innocence—it is making atonement, not a crime;
it is an act of mercy, therefore meritorious.</p>

<p>These were the terrible teachings which the “Reformation”
brought to light:—they had been whispered before among the
elect, and had been acted upon by the “Avenging Angels,”
but before this they had never been publicly and intelligibly
explained.</p>

<p>Jedediah M. Grant, an enthusiast of the wildest kind; a man
without education or mental discipline of any description; one
of the First Presidency and high in authority among the
Saints, had occasion to attend a meeting which was held at
Kaysville, a place about twenty-five miles distant from Salt
Lake City, and he invited some of the Elders to meet him
there to take part in the proceedings. To one of these
“Jeddy,” as he was familiarly called, obligingly lent a mule;
he himself did not accompany the party, but went on before.
These elders were pretty well mounted, and one of them, being
a good horseman, made the rest keep up with him. In consequence
of this, when they arrived at Kaysville, the beasts were
heated and tired. The Apostle “Jeddy” watched them but
said nothing.</p>

<p>Up to a certain point, the meeting passed off pleasantly
enough; the Elders present were “good at testimony” and
strong in exhorting the hearers to faithfulness. Jeddy was
the last speaker. He began in his usual way, but presently
warmed up until he became quite excited, and then proceeded
to accuse every one present of all sorts of wrong-doing. The
Elders who had preceded him came in for their full share; he
denounced them for their inconsistency and hypocrisy, and
bitterly upbraided them for running his mule and their own
beasts in such a manner. The Bishop of the place and his
counsellors he accused of inactivity and carelessness; and he
called loudly upon every one present to repent and do their
first works; threatening them with the speedy judgments of
Heaven.</p>

<p>All this was well enough if it had stopped there, for it might
have been taken for just what it was—an ebullition of temper
on the part of “Jeddy,” who was naturally vexed that his mule
had been over-heated. But, like many other manias and epidemics,
this Mormon movement began with a most insignificant
trifle, and the spirit of fiery denunciation became perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
contagious. Another meeting was held in the course of a few
weeks, and then the mutual accusations of those who were
present became, if possible, more bitter than before; the
“Saints” were denounced as the vilest of sinners, and they
were all commanded to be re-baptized. Accordingly, after the
meeting, although it was night and the weather was cold, a
considerable number were immersed by the Elders, and Jeddy
himself was so enthusiastically engaged in the performance,
and he remained in the water so long that he got a thorough
chill, and contracted the disease of which he died.</p>

<p>Sunday after Sunday similar scenes were repeated in the
Tabernacle, until, had it not been painful, the whole affair
would have been ludicrous in the extreme. Every one had
strayed from the path of duty, and the fact was announced in
the strongest terms. People were called upon by name to
publicly confess their sins, and many were then and there
pointed out and accused of crimes of which they were entirely
guiltless, but which they dared not deny. In the midst of all
this, the duty of implicit obedience to the Priesthood and the
payment of tithes was loudly insisted upon.</p>

<p>The Missionaries were sent out all over the territory, armed
with the full authority of the Priesthood, and also a catechism
which, on account of its obscene character, has since been
bought up so successfully by Brigham that it is doubtful if
there is a copy in existence. The Mormons have a curious
way of appointing Missionaries. If a man is weak in the
faith—a depraved, bad man—or if a youth exhibits a disposition
to sow his wild oats a little too luxuriantly, he is
sent on his travels to preach the Gospel; nothing strengthens
a man’s faith, it is thought, more than having to defend it from
the opposition of unbelievers, and the enforced good example
which the Missionary is obliged to set will, it is said, produce
a salutary effect upon the exuberance of youth or the depravity
of more mature years. In the present instance many of the
Missionaries thus sent forth were known to be as immoral as
they were grossly ignorant.</p>

<p>There was one terrible meeting at which Brigham himself
was put to the blush. Men of note were there; no one was
present who did not belong to the Priesthood. “Jeddy” held
forth, and Heber and Brigham were strong upon the occasion.
In the midst of the proceedings, Brother Brigham, full of
confidence, in the plainest words called upon all who could
not plead guiltless of certain crimes to stand up. Three-fourths
of those present immediately arose. Utterly shocked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the Prophet entered into explanations; but self-convicted
these three-fourths of his hearers stood conscientiously firm.
Even Brigham saw the necessity of taking some stringent
measures. The Saints were told that if they were re-baptized
their sins would be washed away, and they could then say
they were not guilty of the crimes suggested in the catechism.
Subsequently the catechism itself was, as I said, bought up
and burnt.</p>

<p>The burden of every sermon was unquestioning obedience,
repentance, payment of tithing, and above all the taking of
more wives. The Missionaries, without the slightest ceremony,
would visit the houses of respectable Saints, examine them
out of the abominable catechism, and question husbands and
wives in the presence of their children about even their very
thoughts, in a manner, and upon subjects, which would amply
have justified their being hung up to the nearest tree; Lynch
law was in fact too good for such atrocities. Wicked ideas,
the utterance of which would have called forth a blush, even
if heard from the lips of a drunken rowdy in a pot-house, were
suggested and explained to young children; while it would
have been literally at the risk of life for their parents to have
expostulated; to do so would have shown want of faith, and
want of faith would have justified some fanatical scoundrel in
using his knife or his pistol for the loving purpose of cutting
off his brother’s soul from earth in order to save it in
heaven!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jedediah did not for a moment cease his exhortations;
the work must be done thoroughly: the Blood-Atonement
must not be forgotten. On one occasion, in the
Tabernacle, this crazy fanatic said:—</p>

<p>“I would advise some of you men here to go to President
Young, and confess your sins, and ask him to take you outside
the city and have your blood shed to atone for your sins.”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“There are men and women that I would advise to go to
the President immediately, and ask him to appoint a committee
to attend to their case; and then let a place be selected, and
let that committee shed their blood....</p>

<p>“I would ask how many covenant-breakers there are in this
city and in this kingdom? I believe that there are a great
many; and if they are covenant-breakers, we need a place
designated where we can shed their blood.”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“We have been trying long enough with this people, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
go in for letting the sword of the Almighty be unsheathed,
not only in word but <em>in deed</em>.”</p>

<p>Lest he should be mistaken, he said:—</p>

<p>“What ought this meek people who keep the commandments
of God do unto them? ‘Why,’ says one, ‘they ought to pray
<em>the Lord</em> to kill them,’ I want to know if you would wish the
Lord to come down and do all your dirty work?....
When a man prays for a thing, he ought to be willing to perform
it himself.... Putting to death the transgressors would
exhibit the law of God, <em>no matter by whom it was done</em>.”</p>

<p>Heber C. Kimball, the “model Saint,” after a speech to the
same effect, in which, as usual, he made use of the most disgusting
language, added:—</p>

<p>“Joseph Smith was God to the inhabitants of the earth
when he was among us, and Brigham is God now!”</p>

<p>But more shocking than any other was the language of
Brigham Young himself. On the 21st of September, 1856, in
a discourse delivered in the Bowery, Great Salt Lake City, and
afterwards reprinted by authority in the <cite>Journals of Discourses</cite>,
vol. iv., pp. 53-4, he said:—</p>

<p>“The time is coming when justice will be laid to the line
and righteousness to the plummet; when we shall take the
old broadsword and ask, ‘Are you for God?’ and if you are
not heartily on the Lord’s side, <em>you will be hewn down</em>!”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“There are sins that men commit for which they cannot
receive forgiveness in this world or in that which is to come;
and if they had their eyes opened to see their true condition,
they would be perfectly willing to have their blood spilt upon
the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to Heaven as
an offering for their sins, and the smoking incense would atone
for their sins; whereas, if such is not the case, they will stick
to them and remain with them in the spirit world.</p>

<p>“I know, when you hear my brethren telling about cutting
people off from the earth, that you consider it is strong doctrine;
but it is to save them, not to destroy them....</p>

<p>“I do know that there are sins committed of such a nature
that, if the people did understand the doctrine of salvation,
they would tremble because of their situation. And, furthermore,
I know that there are transgressors who, if they knew
themselves, and the only condition upon which they can obtain
forgiveness, would beg of their brethren to shed their blood,
that the smoke thereof might ascend to God as an offering to
appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
law might have its course. I will say, further, I have had
men come to me and offer their lives to atone for their sins.</p>

<p>“It is true that the blood of the Son of God was shed for
sins through the fall and those committed by men, yet men
can commit sins which it can never remit. As it was in
ancient days, so it is in our day; and though the principles
are taught publicly from this stand, still the people do not
understand them; yet the law is precisely the same. There
are sins that can be atoned for by an offering upon an altar, as
in ancient days; and there are sins that the blood of a lamb,
of a calf, or of turtle doves cannot remit, but <em>they must be
atoned for by the blood of the man</em>.”</p>

<p>One would have supposed that even Brigham had now
reached the culminating point of horror and blasphemy. But
no;—a month or so later he even surpassed himself when in a
Tabernacle sermon he said:—</p>

<p>“When will we love our neighbours as ourselves? In the
first place, Jesus said that no man hateth his own flesh. It is
admitted by all that every person loves himself. Now if we
do rightly love ourselves, we want to be saved, and continue
to exist; we want to go into the kingdom where we can enjoy
eternity, and see no more sorrow nor death. This is the
desire of every person who believes in God. Now take a
person in this congregation who has knowledge with regard to
being saved in the kingdom of our God and our Father, and
being exalted, one who knows and understands the principles
of eternal life, and sees the beauties and excellency of the
eternities before him compared with the vain and foolish things
of the world, and suppose that he is overtaken in a gross fault,
that he had committed a sin that he knows will deprive him
of that exaltation which he desires, and that he cannot attain
to it without the shedding of his blood, and also knows that
by having his blood shed he will atone for that sin and be
saved and exalted with the gods, is there a man or a woman
in this house but would say, ‘Shed my blood that I might be
saved and exalted with the gods?’</p>

<p>“All mankind love themselves: and let those principles but
be known by an individual, and <em>he would</em> be glad to have his
blood shed. This would be loving ourselves even unto an
eternal exaltation. Will you love your brothers or sisters
likewise when they have a sin that cannot be atoned for without
the shedding of their blood? Will you love that man or
woman well enough to shed their blood? <em>That is what Jesus
Christ meant.</em> He never told a man or woman to love their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
enemies in their wickedness, never. He never meant any
such thing; His language is left as it is for those to read who
have the spirit to discern between truth and error; it was so
left for those who can discern the things of God. Jesus
Christ never meant that we should love a wicked man in his
wickedness.</p>

<p>“<em>I could refer you to plenty of instances where men have been
righteously slain in order to atone for their sins.</em> I have seen
scores and hundreds of people for whom there would have
been a chance (in the last resurrection there will be) if their
lives had been taken and their blood spilled on the ground as a
smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now angels to
the devil, until our elder brother, Jesus Christ, raises them up
and conquers death, hell, and the grave.</p>

<p>“I have known a great many men who have left this church,
for whom there is no chance whatever for exaltion, but if
their blood had been spilled it would have been better for
them.</p>

<p>“The wickedness and ignorance of the nations forbid this
principle being in full force, but the time will come when the
law of God will be in full force. This is loving our neighbour
as ourselves; if he needs help, <em>help him</em>; if he wants
salvation, and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in
order that he may be saved, <em>spill</em> it.</p>

<p>“Any of you who understand the principles of eternity, if
you have sinned a sin requiring the shedding of blood,
except the sin unto death, should not be satisfied or rest until
your blood should be spilled, that you might gain that salvation
you desire. That is the way to love mankind....
Light and darkness cannot dwell together, and so it is with
the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>“Now, brethren and sisters, will you live your religion?
How many hundreds of times have I asked that question!
Will the Latter-Day Saints live their religion?”</p>

<p>And so, according to Brigham Young, their Prophet, this
was the religion of the Saints! And the people acted up to
the “religion” thus taught: and the story is so terrible that
one dare not even whisper all its details.</p>

<p>It is no secret that all this was understood <em>literally</em>. The
wife of one Elder, when he was absent on a mission, acted
unfaithfully towards him. Her husband took counsel of the
authorities, and was reminded that the shedding of her blood
alone could save her. He returned and told her, but she
asked for time, which was readily granted. One day, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
moment of affection, when she was seated on his knee, he
reminded her of her doom, and suggested that now when their
hearts were full of love was a suitable time for carrying it
into execution. She acquiesced, and <em>out of love</em> he cut her
throat from ear to ear.</p>

<p>In many instances the outrages committed against persons
who were known to be innocent were so revolting that no
woman—nay, even no right-minded man—would venture to
more than just allude to them. <em>A few</em>, however, and only a
few, and they <em>by no means the worst</em>, of the milder cases I
will just mention.</p>

<p>There was the murder of the Aikin party—six persons—who
were killed on their way to California. The same year a
man name Yates was killed under atrocious circumstances;
and Franklin McNeil who had sued Brigham for false imprisonment
and who was killed at his hotel door. There was
Sergeant Pike, and there was Arnold and Drown. There
was Price and William Bryan at Fairfield; there was Almon
Babbitt, and Brassfield, and Dr. Robinson; there was also
James Cowdy and his wife and child, and Margetts and his
wife; and many another, too—to say nothing of that frightful
murder at the Mountain Meadows.</p>

<p>Besides these there is good reason to think that Lieutenant
Gunnison and his party were also victims, although it was
said that they were shot by “Indians.” The Potter and
Parrish murders were notorious; Forbes, and Jones and his
mother, might be added to the same list; the dumb boy,
Andrew Bernard; a woman killed by her own husband;
Morris the rival Prophet, and Banks, and four women who
belonged to their party; Isaac Potter, and Charles Wilson,
and John Walker. These are but a few. The death list is
too long for me to venture to give it.</p>

<p>One instance I can give from my own personal knowledge.
A sister, who occasionally does a little work at my house, on
one occasion said to me: “Mrs. Stenhouse, when first I came
to this country I lived in the southern portion of Utah. One
day I saw a woman running across the fields towards our
house, pale and trembling. When she came in she looked
round her as if she were frightened, and she asked if any one
besides our own family were present. On being assured that
there was no one present whom she might fear, she said:—‘Two
men came to our house late last night and asked to see
my husband, who had already retired. He was in bed, but
they insisted that he must get up, as they had a message from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
“the authorities” for him. When they saw him they requested
him to go with them to attend, they said, to some Church
business. I became very much alarmed, for my poor husband
had been known to speak rather freely of late of some of the
measures of the Church, but he tried to reassure me, and finally
left the house with the two men. In about an hour after
they came back, bearing between them his lifeless body.
They laid him upon the bed, and then one of them pulled
aside the curtain which constituted our only cupboard, and
took therefrom a bake-kettle and stood it beside the bed, in
order to catch the blood that was flowing from a fearful
wound in his throat. They then left the house, telling me to
make as little noise about it as possible, or they might serve
me in the same way. The men were masked, and I cannot tell
who they are, but I spent a fearful night with my poor dead
husband.’” This sister added: “Sister Stenhouse, in those
more fearful times we dared not speak to each other about
such things for fear of spies.”</p>

<p>These were all well-known and notorious instances. I say
nothing of those of whose fate nothing—not even a whisper—was
ever heard; and I say nothing of the frightful “cuttings
off” <em>before</em> the Reformation and in recent years.</p>

<p>Gentile men and women were <em>killed</em>, for hatred; and <em>that</em>
“killing” was no murder, for theirs was not innocent blood.
Apostates, and Saints of doubtful faith, and those who were
obnoxious, <em>had their blood shed</em>—all <em>for love</em>—and that “cutting
off” was also no murder, because to secure their salvation
by cutting their throats was an act of mercy. Can it be possible
that men should thus act and say—and <em>believe</em>—that
Jesus, the gentle and merciful Saviour, commanded it when
He said: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself”?</p>

<p>All through this Reign of Terror, marrying and giving in
marriage was the order of the day. It mattered not if a man
was seventy years of age, according to Brother Brigham he
was still a boy—“the brethren are all boys until they are
a hundred years old”—and some young girl of sixteen, fifteen,
or even younger would be “counselled”—that is, <em>commanded</em>—to
marry him. She might even have a sister no older than
herself, and then as likely as not he would take the two to
wife, and very probably both on the same day. The girls
were told that to marry a young man was not a safe thing, for
young men were not tried—it was better to marry a well-tested
patriarch, and then their chances of “exaltation” in
the kingdom of heaven were sure and certain. In this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the life-long happiness of many a girl—little more than a
child—was blighted for ever. At the time of which I speak,
every unmarried woman, or girl who could by the utmost
stretch of possibility be thought old enough to marry, was
forced to find a husband, or a husband was immediately found
for her, and without any regard to her wishes was forced upon
her. Young men, and even boys, were forced, not only into
marriage, but even polygamy, and none dared resist. The
marrying mania, in fact, was universal and irresistible—everyone
<em>must</em> marry or be given in marriage. So evidently was
this the case that women in jest said that, if one were to hang
a petticoat upon a fence-pole, half a dozen men would flock at
once to marry it! Absurd as this may seem, it was not very
far from the truth. Young men and maidens, old men and children,
widows, virgins, and youths—in fact, every one, whether
married or unmarried, it mattered not, was “counselled”—commanded—to
marry.</p>

<p>There is above fanaticism a stronger law which, despite
every effort of the deluded victim, <em>will</em> occasionally make itself
heard—the voice of Nature. Even during that strange time
in which every Saint seemed to have gone stark crazy mad,
the frightful anomaly of men of fifty, sixty, and even seventy,
marrying mere children—girls of fourteen, and even thirteen—forced
itself upon the attention of some of the leaders.
The question arose—an odd question to Gentile ears—“At
what age is a girl old enough to marry?” Considerable discussion
ensued, and even in the Tabernacle the subject was
taken up. The voice of authority, however, eventually
answered the matter, but not in the way that any ordinary
civilized person would expect.</p>

<p>In those times, unmarried girls were very scarce—in the
settlements it was difficult to find any at all. Not infrequently
it happened that a brother was “counselled” to marry, but
could not obey, as there was no unmarried woman in the place
where he lived. In that case he generally paid a visit to
Salt Lake City. But business at the Endowment House
nevertheless was pretty lively; in fact, so much so that it was
deemed necessary to set apart certain days for the various
Settlements. Once, when the “Provo day” was fast approaching,
two old brethren from that town who had been counselled
to enlarge their families, but who had been unsuccessful in
finding partners, began to despair of being able to obey “the
word of the Lord!” The day before that appointed for the
Endowments and Celestial Marriage arrived, and they were as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
far from success as ever. Being neighbours, the two old
gentlemen met and mingled their griefs, and considered what
might be done. It then occurred to them that there was a
certain brother who had two daughters, respectively <em>twelve</em>
and <em>fourteen</em> years of age, and they resolved to call upon him
about these children. As might be supposed, the father at
first refused them, giving as a reason that the girls were too
young. The old men explained that if they could not marry
the children it was impossible for them to “obey counsel,”
and the father then agreed. The next morning the marriage
ceremony was performed in the Endowment House. One of
these wretches was sixty years of age, and the other a few
years younger. The father of the children was about forty.
I am really afraid that the reader will think that I exaggerate
or misrepresent facts. I wish it were so, for the case is so
outrageously atrocious; but I am sorry to say that scores and
hundreds of instances similar to this, which occurred during
the Reformation, might be given.</p>

<p>There are before me as I write, letters, papers, documents
of various sorts relative to marriage and the matrimonial
affairs of the Saints, at the time of which I speak, that I wish
the reader could peep at. I would not like him to read them—in
fact, I dared not read them all myself, for some of them
are so shameful that the mere knowledge of having read them
through would make any right-minded person blush. Taking
more wives was the order of the day—<em>how</em>, was of little
matter.</p>

<p>The work of “Reformation” was in full progress; the
people were excited to frenzy; the Federal troops were expected;
men were marrying and maidens were given in marriage;
every one in Utah was looking forward to the time
when the Prophecies of Joseph, the Seer, should be fulfilled,
and the Son of Man should come:—and then, when one would
have supposed that every man would have wished that his
hands should be pure, was perpetrated a deed which is unparalleled
in modern civilized times—a deed at which angels
and men have stood aghast with horror.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE:—“I WILL REPAY, SAITH
THE LORD.”</span></h2>

<p>I feel myself utterly incompetent to tell the story of the
Mountain Meadows Massacre—it is so shocking, so fiend-like.
And yet it must be told.</p>

<p>While the work of “Reformation” was going on, and when
the United States troops were constantly expected in the
Valley of the Great Salt Lake, a large train of emigrants
passed through Utah on its way to California. The train
consisted of one hundred and twenty or one hundred and
thirty persons, and they came chiefly from Arkansas. They
were people from the country districts, sober, hard-working,
plain folks, but well-to-do, and, taken all in all, about as
respectable a band of emigrants as ever passed through Salt
Lake City.</p>

<p>Nothing worthy of any particular note occurred to them
until they reached the Valley—that was the point from which
they started towards death.</p>

<p>My old friend Eli B. Kelsey travelled with them from Fort
Bridger to Salt Lake City, and he spoke of them in the
highest terms. If I remember rightly he said that the train
was divided into two parts—the first a rough-and-ready set
of men—regular frontier pioneers; the other a picked community,
the members of which were all more or less connected
by family ties. They travelled along in the most orderly
fashion, without hurry or confusion. On Sunday they rested,
and one of their number who had been a Methodist preacher
conducted divine service. All went well until they reached
Salt Lake City, where they expected to be able to refit and
replenish their stock of provisions; but it was there that they
first discovered that feeling of enmity which finally resulted in
their destruction.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the minds of the Saints in Salt
Lake City were at that time strongly prejudiced against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
people of Arkansas, and for a most unsaintly reason. The
Apostle Parley P. Pratt was one of the earliest converts to
Mormonism, and who so ably defended his adopted creed
with his pen and from the platform, had not very long before
been sojourning in Arkansas, and had there run away with
another man’s wife. This was only a trifle for an “Apostle”
to do, and the husband—Mr. McLean—might have known it.
But he was a most inconsiderate man, and was actually offended
with the amorous Apostle for what he had done. He pursued
him and killed him, for in those rough parts it was considered
that the Apostle did wrong in marrying the man’s wife.
Nobody, however, took any notice of the matter or brought the
murderer to trial. The Mormon people, of course, took the
side of the Apostle Parley P. Pratt. Sensitive themselves to
the highest degree concerning their wives and daughters, they
considered McLean a sinner for doing just exactly what any
Saint would have certainly done. Their opinion, however,
would have been a matter of consequence only to themselves,
had not such fatal consequences resulted from it. Reasoning
without reason, they argued that McLean was the enemy of
every Mormon, and every Mormon was the enemy of McLean;
McLean was protected in Arkansas—therefore every man from
Arkansas was an enemy of the Mormons;—an enemy ought
to be cut off—therefore it was the duty of every Mormon to
“cut off”—if he could—every Arkansas man.</p>

<p>This appears to have been the tone of thought which
actuated the minds of the leaders of the people at the time
when this emigrant train arrived in the City.</p>

<p>Weary and footsore they encamped by the Jordan River,
trusting there to recruit themselves and their teams, and to
replenish their stock of provisions. The harvest in Utah that
year had been abundant, and there was nothing to hinder them
from obtaining a speedy and full supply. Brigham Young
was then Governor of Utah Territory, Commander-in-Chief
of the Militia, and Indian Agent as well: he was therefore
responsible for all that took place within his jurisdiction. It
was his duty to protect all law-abiding persons who either
resided in or travelled through the country. The emigrants,
so far from being protected, were ordered to break up their camp
and move on; and it is said that written instructions were
sent on before them, directing the people in the settlements
through which they would have to pass to have no dealings
with them. This, considering their need of provisions, was
much the same as condemning them to certain death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Compelled to travel on, they pursued their journey slowly
towards Los Angeles. At American Fork they wished to
trade off some of their worn-out stock and to purchase fresh—they
also desired to obtain provisions. There was abundance
of everything from the farm and from the field, for God
had very greatly blessed the land that year; but they could
obtain nothing. They passed on, and went through Battle
Creek, Provo, Springville, Spanish Fork, Payson, Salt Creek,
and Fillmore, and their reception was still the same,—the
word of the Mormon Pontiff had gone forth, and no man
dared to hold communion or to trade with them. Now and
then, some Mormon, weak in the faith or braver or more fond
of money than his fellows, would steal into the camp, in the
darkness of the night, bearing with him just what he was
able to carry; but beyond this they could procure nothing.
Their only hope now lay in the chance of holding out until
they could push through to some Gentile settlement where the
word of the priestly Governor of Utah was not law. Through
fifteen different Mormon settlements did they pass, without
being able to purchase a morsel of bread. With empty waggons
and on short allowance, they pushed on until they
reached Corn Creek, where, for the first time in saintly Utah,
they met a friendly greeting <em>from the Indians</em>, and purchased
from them thirty bushels of corn, of which they stood very
greatly in need.</p>

<p>At Beaver they were again repulsed, and at Parowan they
were not permitted to enter the town—they were forced to
leave the public highway and pass round the west side of the
fort wall. They encamped by the stream, and tried as before
to obtain food and fresh cattle, but again to no purpose.
The reason why they were refused admission to the town
was probably because the militia was there assembled
under Colonel Wm. H. Dame—which militia afterwards
assisted in their destruction, for which preparations were even
now being made.</p>

<p>They made their way to Cedar City, the most populous of
all the towns of Southern Utah. Here they were allowed to
purchase fifty bushels of tithing wheat, and to have it ground
at the mill of that infamous scoundrel John D. Lee, upon
whose memory will rest the eternal curses of all who have
ever heard his name. It was, however, no act of mercy, the
supplying of this corn. The sellers of it knew well enough
even then that it would return to them again in the course of
a few days. After all, they had but forty days’ rations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
carry them on to San Bernardino, in California—a journey of
about seventy days. Scanty kindness—miserable generosity!—fifty
bushels of corn for a seventy days’ journey, for men,
women, and young children, and at least one little one to be
born on the road.</p>

<p>They remained in Cedar City only one day, and so jaded
were their teams that it took them three days to travel thence
to Iron Creek, a distance of twenty miles; and two days
were occupied in journeying fifteen miles—the distance between
Iron Creek and the Meadows.</p>

<p>The morning after they left Iron Creek, the Mormon militia
followed them in pursuit, intending, it is supposed, to assault
them at Clara Crossing. That this was no private outburst,
and that, on the contrary, it was done by authority, is evident
from sworn testimony to the effect that the assembling of those
troops was the result of “<em>a regular military call from the superior
officers to the subordinate officers and privates of the regiments....
Said regiment was duly ordered to muster, armed
and equipped as the law directs, and prepared for field operations.</em>”
A regular military council was held at Parowan, at
which were present President Isaac C. Haight, the Mormon
High Priest of Southern Utah, Colonel Dame, Major John D.
Lee, and the Apostle George A. Smith.</p>

<p>No military council, whether of the militia or the ordinary
troops of the line, would dare to determine upon such an
important matter as the cutting off of an emigrant train of
one hundred and thirty persons without receiving permission
from superior authority. Brigham Young was in this case
the superior authority—he was the Commander-in-Chief of
the Militia:—the inference is obvious. I do not, of course,
say that he gave the order for this accursed deed, but that it
was his business to bring the criminals to justice no one can
doubt or deny.</p>

<p>The regiment, which started from Cedar City under the
command of Major John D. Lee, the sub-agent for Indian
affairs in Southern Utah, was accompanied by baggage-waggons
and the other paraphernalia of war excepting only heavy
artillery, which in this case would have been useless. But, at
the same time, a large body of the Piede Indians had been
invited to accompany them.</p>

<p>An order came from head-quarters to cut off the entire
company except the little children. The emigrants were
utterly unprepared, and the first onslaught found them defenceless.
Accustomed, however, to border warfare, they immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
corralled their waggons and prepared for a siege—their
great misfortune was that they had not any water—Major
John D. Lee, finding the emigrants resolute, sent to
Cedar City and Washington City for reinforcements, which
duly arrived.</p>

<p>The next morning, Major John D. Lee assembled his troops,
including the auxiliaries which he had summoned, about
half a mile from the entrenchment of the fated emigrants,
and then and there informed them, with all the coolness
which such an infamous scoundrel alone could muster, that
the whole company was to be killed, and only the little children
who were too young to remember anything were to be
spared.</p>

<p>The unfortunate emigrants did not know who their foes
were. They saw Indians, or men who were so coloured that
they looked like Indians, and they saw others who were more
than strangers to them, but they had no clue to the cause of
their detention. To them all was mystery. That Indians
should attack them was quite within the bounds of probability,
although there was at that time no cause for such an outrage;
but that such an attack should be persistent, and should be
carried on under the peculiar circumstances in question, was,
to say the least, highly improbable.</p>

<p>Who could rightly tell a story so fearful as this? The
emigrant train—men, women, and children fainting and famishing
for want of bread and meat. In their pockets was
money wherewith the necessaries of life might have been
bought, and the generous hand of the Almighty had that year
been open so wide, and had scattered those necessaries so
liberally, that nothing but the wickedness of man towards his
fellow could have created a dearth. But so it was that darkness
and the fear of death—a fearful death even at the door—was
all those poor emigrants had standing before their eyes.
What right had the Mormon militia to be pursuing, to be
hanging about the skirts of any body of emigrants? Their
very presence was in itself unauthorized—criminal. The
emigrants supposed that they were surrounded by Indians,
and expected the cruellest treatment in case of resistance not
only death, but the outrage and shocking atrocities of savages.
They did not know that the red men who threatened their
lives and the lives of their helpless wives and infants were
brought together at that spot for that same purpose by the
counsel of Mormon authorities. They did not know that so
many of the appearing red-skins were only painted devils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
mocks of humanity, wretches who under the mask of a red-skin’s
colour were eager to perpetrate the foulest of offences—scoundrels
a thousand times damned in the opinion of men, and by
the decree of God.</p>

<p>Day after day went by, and the poor creatures began to
despair—who can wonder? The brave men cared little for
their own lives; but there was something fearful in the
thought that their darling ones would be scalped, and torn in
pieces, and brutally outraged! Who can wonder that they
resolved to sell life as dearly as they possibly could? They
might at least die in defence of those they loved.</p>

<p>So day followed day. The agony of the unhappy men and
women who were thus besieged, and were in daily, hourly peril
of the most frightful of all deaths, can be imagined—not told.
Meanwhile, what were those atrocious scoundrels doing who
were lying in wait for their blood? Some of them were
tricked out as Indians; some were in their own proper dresses;
and, moreover, real Utes were there. The unhappy victims
could not possibly escape—there was time for the murderers
to do their work leisurely. Between chance shots, which were
intended to, and did, carry death with them, they amused themselves
with “pitching horse-shoe quoits:”—such heartlessness
is almost beyond conception.</p>

<p>In terrible need of water, they thought that even the Indians,
who they supposed were their assailants, might possibly respect
a token of truce; so they dressed two little girls in white and
sent them down to the well. But the fiends—the Mormon
militia—shot them down. In the day of doom, the blood of
those babes will testify more heavily against Major John D.
Lee, and Isaac C. Haight, and Colonel Dame, and George A.
Smith, and the other wretch who plotted and contrived that
fearful iniquity, than any of the base and cowardly crimes
which have for years and years blackened their contemptible
and miserable souls.</p>

<p>They could not possibly advance. Their corn would not
last long. They were famishing for water. How long they
could hold out was evidently only a matter of time. Had the
train consisted only of men, they might certainly, if with loss,
have cut their way through their besiegers and escaped; but
with wives and children, and others bound to them by the tenderest
ties, such a thing was impossible. They looked and
waited. Savage Indians they supposed were their only enemies.
Coldly, strangely as they had been treated at the
Mormon settlements, they never for a moment supposed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
white men could be in league against them or could meditate
their destruction.</p>

<p>Up in the meadows—in the distance—there was a white
dusty cloud as if of some person or persons approaching:—the
hearts of the emigrants leaped for joy. Was help coming
at last? It was evident that a waggon was coming near, and
the waggon was filled with armed men;—here was hope. After
all the misery of that waitful watching, they were overjoyed,
and shouted aloud with gladness, and sprang with open arms to
welcome their visitors. Little did they suppose that the fiends
who then came down, with pale faces and the manners of
white men, were the same as those who, painted and decked
out like Indians, had been leaguered about their camp with
murderous intentions for so many days.</p>

<p>The waggon came near, and was found to be filled with
armed men. Surely now, the unhappy emigrants thought,
substantial help had come—the authorities of Utah in the
neighbourhood, whether Gentile or Mormon, had come out
in the cause of civilization and humanity, and succour was at
hand.</p>

<p>A white flag was waved from the waggon as an emblem of
peace, and in order that the emigrants might know that it was
white men and not the red demons of the hills who approached.
They did not, indeed, know that these themselves were the
monsters who had wronged them all this time, and who were
even now compassing their death.</p>

<p>Inside that waggon was President Haight, the infamous
Mormon Bishop John D. Lee, and other authorities of the
Church in Southern Utah. They professed to the emigrants
that they came upon the friendly errand of standing between
them and the Indians. They said that the Indians had taken
offence at something that the emigrants had done, that they
were thirsting for their blood, but that they, the Mormon
officials, were on good terms with them and had influence,
and would use their good offices in the cause of mercy
and of peace. After some discussion they left with the professed
view of conciliating the Indians. Then they returned
and said that the Indians had agreed that, if the emigrants
marched back to Salt Lake City, their lives should be spared;
but that they must leave everything behind them in their
camp, even including the common weapons of defence which
every Western man carries about his person. The Mormon
officials then solemnly undertook to bring an armed force and
to guard the emigrants safely back again to the Settlements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>The emigrants were not cowards, and would doubtless have
preferred to cut their way through to the south, but they could
not leave their wives and little ones, and any terms, however
disadvantageous, were better than leaving those they loved to
the tender mercy of those wretches.</p>

<p>This agreement being made, the Mormon officials retired,
and after a short time again returned with thirty or forty
armed men. Then the emigrants were marched out—the
women and children in the front, and the men following, while
the Mormon guard followed in the rear. When they had
marched in this way about a mile, and had arrived at the place
where the Indians were hid in the bushes on each side of the
road, the signal was given for the slaughter. So taken by surprise
were the emigrants, and so implicitly had they confided
in these murderers, that they offered no resistance. The Mormon
Militia, their guard, immediately opened fire upon them
from the rear, while the Indians, and Mormons disguised as
Indians, who were hidden among the bushes, rushed out upon
them, shooting them down with guns and bows and arrows,
and cutting some of the men’s throats with knives. The
women and children, shrieking with mortal terror, scattered and
fled, some trying to hide in the bushes. Two young girls
actually did escape for about a quarter of a mile, when they
were overtaken and butchered under circumstances of the
greatest brutality. The son of John D. Lee endeavoured to
protect one poor girl who clung to him for help; but his
father, tearing her from him by violence, blew out her brains.
Another unhappy girl is said to have kneeled to this same
monster Lee, entreating him to spare her life. He dragged
her into the bushes, stripped her naked, and cut her throat
from ear to ear, after she had suffered worse at his hands than
death itself. About half an hour was probably occupied in
the butchery, and every soul of that company was cut off,
excepting only a few little children who were supposed to be
too young to understand or remember what had taken place.
The unfortunate victims were stripped, without reference
to age or sex, and then left to rot upon the field. There they
remained until torn and dismembered by the wolves, when it
was then thought prudent to conceal such as lay nearest to
the road. An eye-witness subsequently visiting the spot
said:—</p>

<p>“The scene of the massacre, even at this late day, was horrible
to look upon. Women’s hair in detached locks and in
masses hung to the sage bushes and was strewn over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ground in many places. Parts of little children’s dresses and
of female costume dangled from the shrubbery, or lay scattered
about, and among these, here and there on every hand, for at
least a mile in the direction of the road, by two miles east and
west, there gleamed, bleached white by the weather, the skulls
and other bones of those who had suffered. A glance into the
waggon, when all these had been collected, revealed a sight
which never can be forgotten.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus11">

<p class="caption">SCENE OF THE MOUNTAIN MEADOW MASSACRE.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 255.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The remains were subsequently gathered together by Major
Carleton, the United States Commissioner, who erected over
them a large cairn of stones, surmounted by a cross of red
cedar, with the inscription thereon: “<em>Vengeance is mine: I
will repay, saith the Lord</em>;” and on a stone beneath were engraved
the words:—</p>

<p>“Here 120 men, women, and children were massacred in
cold blood, early in September, 1857. They were from
Arkansas.”</p>

<p>It is said that this monument was subsequently destroyed
by order of Brigham Young, when he visited that part of the
territory.</p>

<p>The little children, while their parents were being butchered,
had clung about their murderers’ knees, entreating mercy, but
none of them finding it save those who were little more than
infants. Their fears and cries the night after the murder are
said to have been heart-rending. One little babe, just beginning
to walk, was shot through the arm. Another little girl
was shot through the ear, and the clothes of most of them were
saturated with their mothers’ blood. They were distributed
among the people of the settlements, and when finally the
Government took them under the protection of the nation,
the people among whom these little ones lived actually
charged for their boarding. Two of them are said to have
uttered some words from which it was presumed that their intelligence
was in advance of their years. They were taken
out quietly and <em>buried</em>! This happened some time after the
massacre.</p>

<p>Most of the property of the emigrants was sold by <em>public
auction</em> in Cedar City: the Indians got most of the flour and
ammunition, and the Mormons the more valuable articles.
They jested over it and called it “Spoil taken at the siege of
Sevastopol.” There is legal proof that the clothing stripped
from the corpses, blood-stained, riddled by the bullets, and
with shreds of flesh attached to it, was placed in the cellar of
the tithing office, where it lay about three weeks, when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
privately sold. The cellar is said to have smelt of it for years.
Long after this time, jewellery torn from the mangled bodies of
the unfortunate women was publicly worn in Salt Lake City,
and every one knew whence it came. A tithing of it all is
reported, upon very conclusive evidence, to have been laid at
the feet of Brigham Young.</p>

<p>This is the story, most imperfectly told, for I dare not
sketch its foulest details, of the Mountain Meadows Massacre.
Brigham Young, who was at the time Governor of the Territory
and also Indian Agent, made no report of the matter. Let
that fact of itself speak for his innocence or guilt. Would
any other governor or agent in another territory have been
thus silent? John D. Lee, and Dame, and Haight, and
the other wretches have never been brought to trial or cut off
from the Church, although their monstrous crime has never been
a secret, nor have any endeavours been made to conceal it.</p>

<p>This fearful deed was one of the unavoidable results of the
teachings of the Mormon leaders during the Reformation.
There were crimes then perpetrated in secret which will never
be known until the day of doom; and there were horrors which
have been known and recorded, but for which no one has been
brought to trial or has suffered inconvenience. There are men
in Salt Lake City, who walk about unblushingly in broad daylight,
but who are known to be murderers, and whose hands
have been again and again dyed with blood under circumstances
of the most atrocious cruelty.</p>

<p>There was one cruel murder, but by no means the worst—which
came under my own personal observation, and which I
have alluded to elsewhere—the murder of Dr. John King Robinson
in Salt Lake City, which attracted more than ordinary
attention. This gentleman was a physician of good standing,
who came out as assistant-surgeon with the United States army,
and afterwards began to practise in Salt Lake City. He was
known as a man of unimpeachable moral character, and there
are to this day hundreds of responsible people who would
testify to his fair fame and rectitude; although he had by some
means incurred the dislike of many of the Mormon leaders.
He formed the idea of taking possession of some warm springs
on the north of the city, and proposed to erect there baths, an
hospital, &amp;c. A small wooden shanty was erected for the
purpose of holding possession, but the city authorities claimed
the spring, and, after some very unpleasant proceedings, the
matter was referred to the law courts, and Judge Titus decided
against the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>After this verdict had been rendered, Dr. Robinson seems
to have acted very prudently, and to have remained in-doors
as much as possible during the succeeding days. Between
eleven and twelve o’clock on the night of the third day, however,
after the family had retired to rest, a man called at the
house, and stating that his brother had broken his leg by a
fall from a mule and was suffering very much, he, after some
earnest persuasion, induced the doctor to accompany him.
Anxious as he might be to remain in-doors at such a time, no
professional man would refuse to perform an act of mercy.
He accordingly went. At a distance of about a couple of
hundred steps from the house he was struck over the head
with some sharp instrument, and immediately after shot
through the brain. His wife, a young girl, to whom he had
only been married a very short time, heard the report of the
pistol, and witnesses saw men fleeing from the spot. The
police were sent for, and the body was carried to Independence
Hall, and afterwards to the victim’s house. The Mayor of
the city was not informed of the murder until ten o’clock the
next day, and the chief of police, who was sitting round the
fire with his men when news of the murder arrived, went to
bed immediately, and did not visit the scene of the outrage for
three days.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, Brigham Young, in the Tabernacle,
publicly suggested that the doctor had probably been murdered
by some of the soldiers from Camp Douglas, who were
dissatisfied with his treatment when they were under his hands,
or else that he had fallen in some gambling transaction—both
of which statements, however, were known by every one
present to be utterly false. No one was ever prosecuted for
this cruel murder. It did not occur during the Reformation,
but was the natural result of the teachings of those times.</p>

<p>I simply mention these facts without any comment of my
own. Let the reader form his own conclusion. More of these
frightful stories I do not care to relate; and I should not even
have presented these to the notice of the reader had it not
been impossible otherwise to give any adequate idea of that
terrible “Reformation.” The Gentile army came in. The
Union Pacific Railroad was opened. Changes and chances
altered all that had been, and brought into being that which
might be, and that which finally really was. Instead of looking
to the events of three or four thousand years ago, men
began to act up to things which were—to think and act in the
present, not to dream of the past. The day has gone by, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
not far, when the perpetration openly of such deeds was
possible; but it is still boasted that, when “<i>Deseret</i>” becomes
a State, the “Saints” will “show still greater zeal <em>for the
Lord</em>!”</p>

<p>In concluding this too brief sketch of the most tragic
episodes in Mormon domestic history, I must warn my readers
against the inference that the ghastly facts and details there
presented came to my knowledge either immediately or soon
after my arrival in Utah. No, it was only after many years’
residence there, and by very slow degrees, that they became
known to me, and the effect which they produced on my mind
was necessarily broken and impaired by the gradual and disconnected
way in which they oozed out, the horrible and
bewildering travesty of biblical argument urged in their defence,
and by my utter isolation from the outer and higher world, and
communication with the heart and brain ennobling influences
of a wholesome and invigorating public opinion.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT WOMEN SUFFER IN POLYGAMY:—THE STORY OF
MARY BURTON.</span></h2>

<p>One bright summer morning, about six months after our
arrival in Salt Lake City, I was sitting in the work-room,
busy with my girls, when a light tap was heard at the door,
and the next instant a lady entered, and, coming straight up
to me, was about to kiss me.</p>

<p>I started back a step, held out my hand, looked her full
in the face, and in a moment we were in each other’s arms.
It was my old friend, Mary Burton!</p>

<p>I could with difficulty find words to express my astonishment
when I recognized her, so greatly was she changed in
every respect. From the very first, whenever we met after a
long separation, I had noticed a more than ordinary alteration
in her appearance. But it must be remembered that at the
time of our first re-union she had grown out of childhood into
womanhood; when I met her again in New York, she had
passed through the most interesting phase of a woman’s life—she
had forsaken maidenhood for matrimony; and now I met
her once more after she had endured those horrors on the
Plains—of which the reader has already heard—and she
had entered into a life of sorrow worse than any she had
known before. No wonder, then, that now, as upon previous
occasions, I noticed quite a startling change in her appearance.
Her dress was of the coarsest and plainest kind, but
neat, as was everything she touched; yet not so carefully
arranged as in the old time in England. She used formerly
to have a way of adjusting a dress or a bonnet so that it set
her off ten times better than it would a girl who had not
naturally the same taste; but now, although, as I said, her
clothes, if coarse, were neat, she evidently had not taken any
pains to set herself off to the best advantage; and in a woman
what a story did that simple fact tell! But it was in her
features and manners that the change was most remarkable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
In looking at her face you would have been puzzled to say in
what the alteration consisted. Her cheeks were thinner and
sadly pale, but that was not the cause of her appearing as she
did. Had she been older, I verily believe the anguish she
had passed through would have blanched her hair and left upon
her brow deep marks of thought and suffering. As it was,
however, though no one feature in particular was very greatly
altered, the whole expression of her face was that of one whose
heart was utterly crushed and broken; and when her eyes
met mine, I could hardly refrain from tears as I saw the mournful
look of subdued pain, which told in them the terrific conflict
which her heart had endured.</p>

<p>I took her to my own room—poor girl, how my heart bled
for her!—and again and again I held her in my arms and
tried to comfort her, for she was very weary; and at last she
wept. I was glad to see that passionate flood of tears, for I
knew it would relieve her, and in that I was not mistaken.
She threw her arms round my neck, and, kissing me repeatedly,
sobbed out, “Don’t blame me, Sister Stenhouse; don’t blame
me very much; I cannot help it.”</p>

<p>“There, there, Mary,” I said; “be calm and you will soon
be better. You must tell me all your troubles, and I will do
all I can to help and comfort you.”</p>

<p>“There is no help, Sister Stenhouse, no comfort for me;
I’m past all that,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Mary,” I said; “I know that you have
passed through a terrible amount of suffering, and have had
much trouble in every way; but your husband is still alive, is
he not?—and there may be many years of happiness before
you.”</p>

<p>“It is the thought of him that makes me so wretched,” she
said; “oh! I could have borne death a thousand times rather
than this. I would gladly have seen him die rather than see him
changed as he is now. You do not know, Sister Stenhouse,
how my whole soul was wrapped up in that man, how I almost
worshipped him. When we suffered so much together on the
Plains, I felt happy in comparison with what I feel now. I
remember that terrible night when I believed he was dying—I
remember the anguish that I felt; but, oh! I knew then
that he loved me and that his heart was all my own. Had I
lost him, if I could myself have lived, I should have felt that
he had never loved another beside me; I should have known
that we would meet together again in heaven and be happy in
each other’s love. After all we went through together, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
loved him more and more; we seemed to live with one life;
we had the same thoughts, and hopes, and pleasures; I leaned
upon him, and I loved him—ah, so fondly! and, Sister Stenhouse,
I know he loved me then. We were getting over the
effects of our sufferings on the Plains, and I was gaining
strength and was looking forward to the time when my child
should be born. It was then that they came and taught him
that devil’s doctrine and led him away from me. Oh dear! I
cannot bear it, Sister Stenhouse, I cannot bear it; it will drive
me mad!”</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands, and sobbed again.</p>

<p>“Mary, dear,” I said, “don’t talk like that; he cannot have
ceased to love you, I am sure; he used to almost worship you,
dear.”</p>

<p>“It is because I know that he did once, that drives me
crazy. You do not know what I feel, and what I have to
bear!”</p>

<p>I did not utter a word; my own sorrows were hidden in
my own heart. The heart knoweth its bitterness, and a
stranger intermeddleth not in the matter. “You have been
through the Endowments?” she asked. “So have I. We
went through, Sister Stenhouse, about three months after we
came to Utah, and never since then have I known a moment’s
peace. I do not know what they said to my husband, but,
whatever it was, it produced a great effect upon his mind,
and changed him altogether; he has been an altered man from
that very time. I have no doubt that they told them that it
was his duty to take another wife, and they would say that no
promise made to me before our marriage was binding if it
comes in opposition to our religion. You know how devoted
he is, how firm his faith is. Why, I do believe that he
would obey counsel even if it broke his heart, and cost him
his life. Did they say nothing to you or your husband, dear?”</p>

<p>“Certainly they did, Mary; we have heard it daily and
hourly, and my husband is constantly being counselled about
it. I am wretched, Mary, you know I must be; I feel just as
you do, but how can we help ourselves?”</p>

<p>“No, we cannot help ourselves, there is no hope,” she said;
“but it is a cruel wrong. You know well enough how determined
I was never to marry a man who would take another
wife. When I thought that Elder Shrewsbury might be influenced
by his religion, I made him go to the Apostle and get
counsel, and then he solemnly vowed to me that he never
would enter into polygamy without my consent; which, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
course, was the same as saying that he never would do so at
all. Until we went through our Endowments, he never even
hinted at such a thing. But they spoke to him then; and
one day, after he had been having a long consultation with the
Bishop, he came and spoke to me. He was not unkind in the
least. In fact he seemed to be as much pained at all mention
of the subject as I was. He said that the Bishop had been
urging him to live up to his privileges, and had explained to
him how great a loss in the celestial world it would be, both
to him and to me, if he did not take more wives. He was told
that now while he was young was the time, and that I would
soon get over any pain that I might suffer. Yes, they actually
said so. Fancy tearing out the very affections of one’s heart,
and blasting every hope and happiness in life, and then
saying that I should soon ‘get used to it!’ I tell you, Sister
Stenhouse, a true woman never can ‘get used’ to this hideous
system. If the hearts of some are dead and cold, it is a curse
to them and a curse to their husband and children; and if a
wife seems careless or callous, as the case may be, it is because
love for her husband has first died out in her heart. She feels
no jealousy because she has no love; but if a woman has but a
spark of love for her husband, she will hate with a deadly
hatred any other woman whom that husband loves.”</p>

<p>“But what did Elder Shrewsbury say when they told him
to enter into polygamy?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“At first he told them it was utterly impossible,” she replied,
“and he mentioned his promise to me, and said we were very
happy together, and that he wished for nothing more. But
they knew his weakness, and that he would do anything for
his religion, and they urged him on that point. It was even a
sin against me they said, for if he had no more than one wife
he could never exalt me in the celestial kingdom; that I
ought to be treated like a child—a very dear, but spoilt child;
and if I refused what was for my own and my husband’s
benefit and everlasting welfare, he ought to act up to what he
knew was right, and leave the consequences with the Lord,
who would order all things for the best. My husband told me
all this very sadly at first, but I could see that it had an effect
upon his mind. They saw it, too, and did not let the subject
drop. Every day they spoke to him of it, and at last he gave
way—for <em>my</em> sake, he said! This was the cruellest wrong of
all. Then one day he told me very firmly and very coldly, as
if he had steeled his heart to do so, that he had made up his
mind to take another wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” I exclaimed, “after the solemn oath he swore
never to do such a thing? Why, I could not have believed it
of Elder Shrewsbury!”</p>

<p>“I reminded him of his promise,” she said, “but he told me
that the Revelation justified him in breaking it; that it said
in the second clause that ‘All covenants, contracts, and oaths
not sealed by him who is appointed on earth to hold this power
in the last days are of no force after the resurrection;’ that
for this cause we had been married again for eternity, and that
now he was free from his oath. I knelt down before him, and
I wept and prayed as if for life itself; I entreated him, if no
more, to wait and put off all thoughts of another marriage for
a few months, until he had time to consider the matter carefully.
He had already thoroughly thought it over, he said,
and could not go back now, for the Bishop had chosen a wife
for him, and had arranged everything. He even told me who
it was—a young girl named Wilbur, about fourteen years of
age—a mere child. I prayed him if he would be so wicked as
to perjure himself and wrong me so foully, at least not to add
to his sin by injuring a poor innocent child. He was very
indignant with me for that, said that he was doing the child
the greatest good he possibly could by marrying her; that he
was ensuring her salvation as well as mine; and that he expected
to receive the blessing of God.”</p>

<p>“Mary,” I said, “this system is a fearful curse.”</p>

<p>“Curse!” she exclaimed, “curse is a heavenly word to apply
to such a system. Why there is nothing in hell so hateful, so
vile, so detestable. It is blight and ruin to everything that is
fair and good. I never pass a day but I curse with the bitterest
hatred the men who devised it. Women <em>can</em> hate bitterly when
they choose; but I hate <em>them</em> more than ever woman hated
before.”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush, dear!” I said; “you mustn’t talk so, Mary!”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t say it perhaps—it’s dangerous, I know; but I
may think so. There is not a true-hearted woman in Utah
who does not feel as I do this day. Do you think that when
they have ruined all our hopes for time and for eternity we
shall love them still? Here, but for this wretched system, I
should have been a happy wife and mother, and now see what
I am—husband, child, all lost—all lost!”</p>

<p>“Is the child dead, Mary?” I asked very gently, for I
feared to pain her.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” she replied, “in fact, I believe it never lived—the
one I was thinking of. I was ill, very ill indeed, after what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
my husband had told me. They thought I should die, and I
think he was sorry, for he became very kind and tender to me,
but that only made me feel worse. Then my child was born,
but I never saw it, for I was unconscious for more than a week
after, and then they told me that it was not alive, but my husband
would never speak to me about it. As I grew better, his
cold, stern manner returned, and then at last he married that
girl Wilbur, and since then he has married two more, for he is
doing very well in business. I think that all his love for me
has gone. At first he thought of marrying again because it
was a religious principle; and as it was the time of the Reformation
he did not dare to refuse; but now his heart is grown
hard and cold. You see a change in me, Sister Stenhouse, but I
think you’d see a greater change in him. I know, of course,
that I used to look at him with the eyes of love, and of course
did not see him as other people did; but that is not the only
change—it isn’t in his face alone; his whole nature is altered.
It quite pains me sometimes to see him.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel any happier now—any calmer, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “yes, and no. I do not love him as I used
to; how could I? But when I look into my heart I find, if I
tell you the truth, that a little love <em>does</em> remain there. If only
I could <em>quite</em> cease to love him I think I should be happy; but
when I pet and play with my little girl—for we have had one
child since that dreadful time—some of my love for him comes
back again, and I sit down and have a good cry. Sometimes
that isn’t enough to calm me, and I shut the door and walk up
and down the room and swear. There! don’t look so horrified,
Sister Stenhouse, I cannot help it; if I did not give way to
my feelings now and then I should die outright; and sometimes
I break a few things, but he never knows it, and it does me
good. We came into the city yesterday on a visit, and we
shall stay for a few days. He brought me, I believe, as a
matter of form; but I found out where you lived, and I came
to see you. You never answered my letter, and I did not know
whether you had left New York yet. I really <em>am</em> glad to see
you, Sister Stenhouse. And is it true that Brother Stenhouse
has not taken another wife yet?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” I said; “but, as I told you, he has been spoken
to about it, and I cannot tell what he may do. As you say,
Mary, the Mormon women have not much to make them
happy.”</p>

<p>Mary gave me a great deal of information. In that she was
quite herself, as I knew her in by-gone days. Nothing escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
her observation. She sat down with me and told me all her
troubles, and I need hardly say how deeply I sympathized with
her. So I tried to comfort her, and spoke about her child, but
even respecting that poor little thing she felt no hope. “Why,
when it grows up,” she said, “it will be as miserable as I am—I
can see no prospect of happiness in the future for it.” We
agreed that the only way whereby we might prevent our children
from experiencing sorrow and misery similar to our own
was to teach them from the very first that Polygamy was the
natural and proper, as well as the revealed order of marriage;
in fact to “bring them up” in the system. What a miserable
resource was this for a mother who loved her children!</p>

<p>“One thing, Mary,” I said, referring to her own personal
experience in Polygamy; “one thing I do not quite understand.
<em>You</em>, of course, had made your husband specially promise, before
you married him, that he would never take another wife, and
he was therefore bound, as a man, by every moral obligation,
not to do so. But other women have not been situated as you
were, and they have exacted no promises from their husbands.
Yet it always seemed to me that your doing so was quite
superfluous, for you must be aware, Mary, that the Revelation
says that, before a man can take a second wife, he must have
the full consent of the first. The elders in Europe used to
make a great deal of that point, as you may remember, for they
said that this provision took from the Revelation any harshness
or injustice which it might otherwise appear to show. I
know many women who submitted on this account, for they
argued that, if their permission was necessary, they could
always, by refusing, save themselves from any further trouble.
Now if that was so, how came <em>your</em> husband to take another
wife against your will? I say <em>your</em> husband, because I should
have no difficulty in many other cases. I have been repeatedly
told that husbands never troubled themselves about the Revelation
when they wanted another wife, unless it was to silence
the first wife with it, if she rebelled. But I always regarded
Elder Shrewsbury as a conscientious man, and I firmly
believed that he would never willingly give you a moment’s
pain. When he made that promise to you, he had the Revelation
before him, and had also the Apostle to go to if he
needed the ‘Word of the Lord.’ He was therefore bound by
that promise, notwithstanding anything that the Revelation
might say to the contrary; and even had he made no promise,
the Revelation was on your side. We are told that every
woman must first give her consent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is all very true, Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “to a
certain extent. The theory is as you say, but you have not
heard the whole. I know the Revelation pretty nearly by
heart, and so I can tell you exactly what it does say. The first
wife is said to hold the keys of this power, by which is meant
that she can refuse. But then it goes on to say that when her
husband has taught her the law of the Priesthood—that is
Polygamy—‘<em>she shall believe or she shall be destroyed</em>, saith
the Lord your God, for I will destroy her.’ You see there is no
loophole of escape for the woman. Her husband is to teach
her the law, and she <em>shall</em> believe; and if she does not—and
of course people have no power to make themselves believe
what they please—she is to be destroyed, and God will destroy
her! Do you know, Sister Stenhouse, there are stories
whispered here of women who <em>did</em> refuse, and who stood in
their husbands’ way; and it is said that the Priesthood did not
wait for the Lord to destroy, but carried out the law themselves.
But we have wandered sadly from your question.
You were talking about the first wife giving her consent?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “and you were about to tell me whether it
was really and practically necessary in every instance. You
have been here longer, and have seen more, than I have.”</p>

<p>“The wife’s consent is by no means necessary, Sister Stenhouse.
It may be asked sometimes as a mere matter of form,
and, of course, in the Endowment House, when she gives the
other wives to her husband, she may be said to give her consent
to his marrying them. It is nothing but a piece of folly
to talk about women having the power to withhold their consent,
and it is simply an insult and a mockery for their husbands
to ask it; they well know before they ask that their
wives dare not refuse to give it. But it enables them to boast
to the Gentiles that they do not take other wives until their
first wife gives her consent. This is what is meant by ‘the
liberty of the Gospel,’ I suppose, about which Brother Brigham
talks so much. But every one knows perfectly well that
this is all a farce. Without President Young’s consent there
can be no marriage at all; but if it is the will of Brigham, the
refusal of the first wife, and the parents, and the girl herself
do not for a moment signify.”</p>

<p>“But did your husband, Mary, act in this way?”</p>

<p>“Well, not quite. He told me that, if I refused, it would
make not the slightest difference; and as I believed him, I, of
course, went, and did not make a scene. It would have only
made matters worse. Some of the older sisters came round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and talked me over, and explained and insisted, and ‘laboured’
with me as they called it, until I hardly knew what to think
or do; my mind was quite unsettled. Eliza R. Snow is quite
great at that sort of work. When my husband took his other
two wives, he did not consult me at all, but simply told me
that on a certain day I must go with him to the Endowment
House. We went, and he married two sisters on the same
day, but it did not do him much good. They are handsome
girls, but have very bad tempers, and we often have a very
unpleasant time. The second wife, poor child! suffered most
when he married the other two. She did not seem to like
me very well at first, which was quite natural; but, when the
other two were brought home, she seemed quite to cling to
me, and I have, strange to say, taken quite a fancy to her.
In all our disputes she always sides with me, and in return I
always stand up for her, as a matter of course. I am getting
used to this wretched life; I try to stifle my love; and I
am sorry to say that sometimes I almost hate every one around
me, including my husband. Now and then the old longing
for some one to love, for some one to confide in, comes over
me. I felt like that this morning when I came here, and that
is what made me act so badly.”</p>

<p>“Say nothing of that, Mary,” I replied. “I wish you
would stay with me while you are in the city.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “we shall be here for a day or two, but I
do not think my husband would like me to stay here
altogether. He knows that you are aware of his attachment
to me once, and his promises in the old times, and very likely
he would be a little ashamed to meet you. He’ll make
business an excuse, and in fact he is busy all the day. So
I’ll come round alone as much as I can, and we’ll have a good
talk again.”</p>

<p>I saw her to the door, and then she turned and said, “I’ll
come again and see you, Sister Stenhouse, before we leave the
city.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, she kissed me, laughed with the ghost of her
former merry ways when I first knew her, and said good-bye.
I watched her till she was lost to sight, and then I closed the
door, saying to myself, with a sigh, “Ah, me! can this be the
Mary that I once knew?”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW MARRIAGES ARE MADE IN UTAH—A NEW WIFE FOUND
FOR MY HUSBAND.</span></h2>

<p>Not long after this, I was enabled to visit my Swiss friend,
Madame Bailiff. Ever since her husband had called upon me
in Salt Lake City, I had watched anxiously for an opportunity
of seeing her, for I felt much interested in learning how
time had passed with her since we parted in Geneva.</p>

<p>I found her in a little log-cabin of two rooms, with bare
walls, bare floor, and miserably furnished; and in this wretched
abode poverty and polygamy had wrecked the life of my poor
friend, whom I had known under such different circumstances.
Here, together with their five children, lived also
the second wife, with <em>her</em> two children. It was with difficulty
that I could recognize in the poor, careworn, broken-spirited,
and ill-clad woman who stood before me, the once
gay, light-hearted, happy, and elegantly-dressed lady whom I
had known in Switzerland. Mormonism had in her case
utterly blighted her existence. It seemed to me hardly possible
that so great a change should have been wrought in her in
such a few years as had elapsed since last I saw her. What
suffering she must have endured, I thought, what mental
agony, what physical pain, to write those wrinkled lines of care
upon her once handsome face; and, ah! what a pang I felt at
the remembrance that I myself had been instrumental in
leading her into Mormonism and Polygamy. Self-reproach
I did not feel, but sorrow I did. I had thought to lead her
into the way of holiness and heavenly peace by winning
her to the religion of the Saints, but that which I in my
enthusiasm had believed would be the greatest blessing which
one poor mortal could communicate to another, had turned
to a curse, and, instead of the happy wife and mother which she
once had been, she had become a victim to that faith which
in its very existence is an insult to womanhood.</p>

<p>In temper and disposition she was, however, just the same;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
her affectionate nature was unchanged. No doubt she read
in my features the painful surprise which I experienced in
witnessing her altered circumstances; but she met me with
not a single word of reproach for my being the cause of her
leaving her own dear country. I should not have blamed her
had she hated me, though she knew, of course, that I had
wronged her innocently.</p>

<p>She told me of the difficulties which they had had to contend
with after their arrival in Utah, and how they had been
compelled to part with almost everything they had, in order to
provide bread for their children. When they left London,
they took with them several handsome carpets, china, glass,
and a large quantity of silver ware, besides bedding and clothing
of every description; for they were well-to-do in the world,
and had quite enough for themselves, after they had liberally
assisted the poorer Saints to emigrate. Upon their arrival in
Utah, the husband—good man that he was—was willing to
come down to the level of his brethren and go to farming
among them. A brother who knew him in his own country,
and imagined, I suppose, that he could afford to lose, sold him
a farm that he himself had become disgusted with, though, of
course, he did not say so; and when my inexperienced friend,
Monsieur Bailiff, found that nothing could be done with it,
he supposed that the land was good enough, but that he himself
was not competent to work it. No one ventured to hint
that he had been cheated, as it was one of the Church
authorities who had sold him the land. After spending upon
it all that he possessed, he was finally compelled to abandon
it. They were now very much straitened in circumstances,
and my poor friend told me that she had frequently been compelled—as
they were entirely destitute of money—to take a
silver spoon or fork to the butcher’s market to trade with, and
there they drove a hard bargain with her, and she obtained
next to nothing in exchange for her silver. Her crystal and
plate now grace the table of a certain rich man in Utah.
Every article they possessed went in this way at a most
ruinous sacrifice, until nothing remained; and then the husband
was forced to engage in manual labour, while the poor
wife employed herself in whatever feminine work she could
obtain; they receiving in return just what people chose to pay
them. In the midst of their troubles the husband was “counselled”
to take another wife.</p>

<p>“But why did he not refuse to do so?” I asked.</p>

<p>“If you had been here during the Reformation, you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
not ask me such a question as that. Sister Stenhouse, you
ought to thank God that you were not here then. There were
shocking things done at that time, and the men were all crazy
about marrying. They married every woman who was single,
and even little girls who had scarcely reached their teens; it
was a time of terror, and no one dared to rebel.”</p>

<p>She then told me that her husband had been, as one might
say, compelled to marry a young Swiss girl whom they had
brought out to Utah with them as a domestic. This girl had
been a very faithful servant, and Madame Bailiff had become
very much attached to her. During the Reformation the
Bishop visited them, and “counselled” Monsieur Bailiff to take
a second wife. The girl was also “counselled” to marry, and
when she said that she did not know of any one to whom she
would like to be married, the Bishop told her that he himself
would find a suitable man.</p>

<p>“My husband told me what the Bishop had urged him to
do,” said Madame Bailiff, “and we talked the matter over in
a practical way. We knew that the girl would be forced to
marry somebody, and that then she would have to leave us,
which would put us to the very greatest inconvenience, for,
situated as we were, we could hardly get on without her
assistance. At the same time, he also would be compelled to
obey counsel, and we came to the conclusion that as there was
no way of evading the difficulty altogether, it would be better
for him to marry the girl than to bring a stranger into the
house. So he asked her, and she accepted him, and they were
married. She is a good girl, and tries to do her best, but it is a
great trial to me, and one which I trust you may never be
called upon to bear. My husband is as kind and gentle a man
as ever lived, and he has done all he could to keep me from
feeling unhappy; had it been otherwise, I dare not think what
I should have done—I believe I should have gone mad or
died. In our household arrangements, of course it made very
little difference, but it was inexpressibly painful to me, and
though I suppose I shall remain a Mormon till the day of
my death, I have learned to hate Mormonism.”</p>

<p>Poor Madame Bailiff! Hers was a life of privation and
sorrow of late years. Happy as woman could be in her
youthful days, she little dreamed what Providence had in
store for her ere her earthly course had run. With a faithful
and devoted husband; with a charming little family growing
up around her; with all that could make life fair and
beautiful. But that accursed thing—Polygamy—came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
poisoned all her happiness, and blighted all her hopes; and
when, but a few months ago, worn out and weary of life,
she left behind her all her sorrows and all her misery, I could
not weep that she had gone to a better land beyond the veil,
but I thanked God that at last, poor soul, her days of trial
were for ever over, and she had entered into her eternal rest.</p>

<p>One day Brother Brigham sent me word that he wished to
see me.</p>

<p>I went to him, and he told me that he wanted me to become
acquainted with a certain young girl in whom he took a great
interest. She was the daughter, by his first wife, of Jedediah
M. Grant, the famous Apostle of the “Reformation”—her
name was Carrie, and she was now an orphan. Brother Brigham
wished me to have her with me every day, for she was
not “feeling well,” he said, and he thought I might do her
some good. This “not feeling well” I afterwards discovered
meant that she was almost ready to apostatize. If she desired
it, I was to teach her my business; not that she needed to
follow any profession, for, as President Young explained, she
had a good home; but her mind needed occupation, and he
did not care how she employed her time, so long as she was
with me every day and could be made to “feel well.”</p>

<p>I listened to all that Brother Brigham said, and accepted
the trust in good faith—not only to please him, but because
the girl was an orphan, and my heart went out towards her
even before I had seen her.</p>

<p>Before I returned home I called at the house where Carrie
was stopping, and arranged that she should come every day to
see me, under pretext of learning the business. Now it so
happened that we each conceived a liking to the other the
very first moment we met; we made friends together at once,
and she wanted to begin coming to me the very next day.
She was a sweet-looking and intelligent girl, fair, but
fragile, and with a peculiar expression of melancholy sadness
dwelling upon her features, which gave her a painfully interesting
appearance. I never before, or since, met with a young
girl who habitually looked so unhappy; and I thought that
perhaps physical weakness might be the cause, for it was evident
that in constitution she was extremely delicate—I almost
feared consumptive.</p>

<p>The first day we spent together she told me that her parents
had been among the pioneers to Utah, that her only sister had
died on the Plains, and that she had lost her mother soon
after they had arrived in Salt Lake City. As the only remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
child of her mother, she had been a great pet with
her father, but he too had died about four years previous to
the time of which I speak, and she had never been happy
since. “I often long to die,” she said, “that I might join my
mother and father; no one loves me here, and I have nothing
to live for.” Her father had married four wives after her
mother’s death, and they were all very kind to her, but she did
not feel that she had a home. She told me that about six
months before she came to me she had started to go east, to
her mother’s friends, for they had frequently written to her,
urging her to come to them, and that when she was about
two weeks’ journey from Salt Lake City, Brigham Young
sent after her, and she was brought back. “But,” she said,
“I shall never be happy here, Sister Stenhouse, I know I
never shall; and why should they not let me leave and go to
my relatives?”</p>

<p>I knew very well that it was of no use for her to try to get
away, for we had no railroad then, and escape was almost impossible.
I therefore tried to make her more cheerful, and
told her that a girl as young as she was—for she was scarcely
seventeen—had much to live for. But her unhappiness had
become almost a settled melancholy, and she seemed to be
interested in nothing. Besides which, the task I attempted
was all the more difficult as I was not at all happy
myself.</p>

<p>One day the conversation happened to turn upon Polygamy,
and in a moment I saw that all her trouble arose from that
miserable doctrine, and from that alone. We had not exchanged
many words upon the subject when she exclaimed:
“Oh, how I hate Polygamy! God forgive me; but I cannot
help it, Sister Stenhouse! I do hate it; and yet I believe
that it is true.” Poor child! I understood her too well, for
her position was exactly mine. From that moment we were
fast friends.</p>

<p>Here was the child of one of the greatest fanatics that
Mormonism has ever known, one of the wildest advocates of
the “Celestial Order of Marriage,” perfectly loathing the
system; and yet, poor girl, believing it firmly, and believing
too that she could not obtain salvation unless she entered into
it. How I pitied and loved that poor girl!—and yet what
strength or consolation could I offer her, being myself as
painfully situated as she was? Our mutual sorrow united us
still more painfully in loving companionship. I had rarely
met among the Mormon girls with one so thoughtful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
observing, so kind and gentle. She had not been with me
many weeks before she had entwined herself so completely
round my heart that I was lonely when she stayed away, and
I tried to keep her with me altogether. I tried in every
way to make her feel at home when at my house; and
noticing her delicate health, and thinking that she did not
always get those little things to tempt her appetite which an
invalid should always have, I found out many trifles which
I believed would please her, and always tried to get them
for her. She seemed to think much of these little attentions,
and I have always believed that she loved me very
dearly.</p>

<p>Some of my neighbours began to whisper pretty plainly to
me that Brother Brigham had an object in view in asking me
to interest myself in Carrie’s welfare. They told me they
believed that my husband, if he had not already been counselled
to marry her, would be before long. Knowing, as I
did, Carrie’s aversion to Polygamy, these suggestions did not
trouble me very much; but I begged my informants not to
speak of the matter in my young friend’s presence, as it would
only disturb and annoy her. I was the more anxious on
this point as her health had by that time began very perceptibly
to improve, and sometimes she seemed to be almost joyous
and light-hearted. Sometimes she would sew, and sometimes
she read or played with the children, of whom she was
very fond, and I always allowed her to do just as she
pleased.</p>

<p>One day my talkative friend called to see me. She had
not been near the house for several months, and I think, at
her last visit, she must have taken offence at my telling her
that I thought she had not acted wisely in procuring wives
for her husband. She had, however, now an object in coming
which I soon discovered.</p>

<p>She was shown in, and as soon as she was fairly seated, I
observed that, while talking to me, she was inquisitively scrutinizing
Carrie’s face, as if trying to discover her character or
read her thoughts. Suddenly—she did everything impulsively—she
interrupted the conversation, saying: “Sister Stenhouse,
I want to speak to you privately.” I asked her to come with
me into the next room, and she did so, but before I had time
to close the door, she exclaimed: “Allow me to congratulate
you; you have done very wisely!”</p>

<p>“Congratulate me upon what?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Upon the excellent choice you have made for your husband,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
she replied; “I knew very well you would ponder over
my good counsel and seek another wife for Brother Stenhouse,
and I am certain that my example and my faith and prayers
have helped you, for I have asked the Lord to strengthen you
to do just what you are doing.”</p>

<p>“Doing!” I said, “what am I doing? I really don’t
understand what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” she exclaimed; “but I understand, if you
don’t. You wish to keep it a secret, I suppose, until the
happy event takes place. And you are quite right in that, for
there are so many busybodies here, and they do interfere so
much in their neighbours’ affairs that it isn’t pleasant. But of
course you needn’t fear <em>me</em>—<em>I</em> shouldn’t think of breathing
one single word of the matter, unless you wished me to do
so.”</p>

<p>“I am really at a loss to know what you mean,” I said, very
much annoyed with her.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said, “if you think that I am interfering, I will
not say another word, for I should very much dislike to be considered
meddlesome. But you know, my dear Sister Stenhouse,
the great interest I have always felt concerning you;
from the very first when I knew you in England I always
prophesied great things of you, but I was a little afraid when
I saw your opposition to Polygamy, and I cannot tell how
happy I felt when I heard yesterday that you had found a
wife—and a good wife too—for your husband.”</p>

<p>“I find a wife for my husband!” I exclaimed. “That I never
would. I dislike Polygamy far too much to do so. No;
if he ever wants another wife, I shall never help him to
find her; he’ll have to get her himself.”</p>

<p>“Who is that young girl, then, that I saw just now?” she
asked; “is that not Miss Grant?”</p>

<p>I replied that it was.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “I was told that you had asked her to
marry your husband.”</p>

<p>“There is no truth in the report,” I said; “I am sure that
she has never thought of such a thing, nor have I, nor has my
husband; and I would not have such a thing spoken of for the
world.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she replied, “I am really quite disappointed. You
have a splendid opportunity, and I do believe that that was
what Brother Brigham meant when he asked me to see after
her. In fact, I was told that it was his only motive, all
along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then Brother Brigham will soon find out his mistake,
I can assure you,” I answered, “for I never will ask her;
and, moreover, if I thought for a moment that she would
ever wish such a thing, much as I love her, I should then
hate her.”</p>

<p>“My dear Sister,” she said, “how do you expect ever to
get salvation? I suppose you think that is none of my business,
and that I should leave you in the hands of the Lord.
But before I go, let me ask you to see Eliza Snow as soon as
you have an opportunity. She will build you up, and do
you a world of good.”</p>

<p>I told her I needed no “building up;” all I wanted was
that my husband and myself should be left alone, and that
people should not meddle with our affairs.</p>

<p>After she had gone, her conversation troubled me a great
deal. What did it all mean? Had the busybodies been trying
to bring about an alliance between my husband and
Carrie? Had Brigham Young been working all along to this
end? However it might be, I resolved that, at least, Carrie
should know nothing of the matter from me.</p>

<p>One morning, the Apostle Heber C. Kimball called in his
carriage. It was very early, being only about seven o’clock.
Mr. Stenhouse went out to see him, but in his blunt way he
said: “I do not want you, I want Sister Fanny to take a ride
with me.” My husband brought him into the house and he
told me he wanted to have a talk with me. “You must not
fix up,” he said, “or I won’t ride with you. Come along in
your wrapper and slippers, and just put on your sun-bonnet.”</p>

<p>I told him that I never went out in a sun-bonnet. “Well,
then, do it for the first time,” he said.</p>

<p>I suggested that I had had no breakfast, and asked him if
he would wait and have some with us.</p>

<p>“No,” said he; “I have plenty of wives around this town,
and we will find breakfast somewhere.” So I started just as
I was, and he told the driver—who, I think, was one of his
own sons—to call round and see “the folks”—meaning his
wives. Then, turning to me, he said: “You never looked
prettier, Sister Fanny; you ought always to wear a sun-bonnet,
but you like dress a great deal too much—you will keep
your husband poor, and then how will he be able to carry
out the commands of God? Did you ever think of that?
Then, again, you dress your children too much; it must take
pretty well all your time to make their clothes; and see what
it must cost. Now, I’m going to give you some good advice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Do what my folks do. I tell them to make a linsey dress for
each of the children in the spring, and let them wear it all
the summer; and then, when the winter comes, it will be so
full of grease and dirt that it will be sure to keep them warm.
Now I’m sure you won’t consent to do that with your children,
so it is good counsel thrown away.” I knew well enough
that Brother Heber was only jesting, for apparently he provided
very well for his family, although he allowed them no
luxuries. He went on to say: “But that isn’t what I wanted
to speak to you about; I had something else to say. When
is your husband going to marry Miss Grant? That girl has
got to be looked after by some good man and woman, and I
think that you and Brother Stenhouse will do first-class. What
do you think?”</p>

<p>“I should not like my husband to marry her,” I said.</p>

<p>“And why not, Sister Fanny?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because I myself love her,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Why, that is the very reason why he ought to do it the
sooner,” he said, “and you would continue to love her, and
love her all the better too, when she belonged to your husband,
and when you saw how much he loved her.” He
laughed outright as he said this, and told me not to look so
solemn. “Why,” he said, “it’s the finest thing in the world
to develope love in the women; a man never gets so much attention
in his life as when he has got several wives all trying
their best to please him.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” I said; “but who is to pay attention to
their wives?”</p>

<p>“Things have been all upside down in the world, Sister
Fanny,” he answered, “and the Priesthood is going to set
them all in order. It is the women’s place to minister to
the men, and the men, in return, will save them in the Kingdom,
if they are good girls.”</p>

<p>By this time we had driven round several of his fields in the
lower part of the city, and at last we stopped at the house of
one of his wives. She very kindly prepared breakfast for us;
after which we called to see two or three other wives, and
then returned home. On the way back he tried to get me to
promise that I would persuade my husband to marry Miss
Grant. This I positively refused to do, although it would
have been dangerous for me not to acquiesce had it not been
that Brother Heber was attached to me and allowed me to say
what I liked against Polygamy, laughing at me and telling me
to “hold on” when I became too much in earnest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>This constant reference to Carrie began to trouble me
seriously, although, so far, I had not yet spoken about it
either to her or to my husband, and did not intend to do it.
I felt sure that Carrie, poor child, was perfectly innocent; she
had refused to go to several parties with us, and had otherwise
declined to accompany my husband, and I believed that
I had no cause for uneasiness.</p>

<p>Thus time passed, and more than a year flew by, and Carrie
still remained with me. Lately I thought that her manner
was changed, and that she was a good deal altered. I noticed
that she was shy when in the presence of my husband, and
that she rather avoided him. For a long time I had not suspected
that anything was wrong between them, and the knowledge
that Carrie was troubled, and that my husband was the
cause, came upon me suddenly. She began by staying away
for several days at a time, and at last she told me that she was
going away for a while to visit a friend in the country. She
looked so unhappy that I felt sure that all was not right, and
begged her not to go, but she would not listen to me. It was
necessary for her to go, she stated, and would say no more.
She bade me good-bye, and for two months I heard nothing
of her, supposing that she was in the country, and then I was
surprised to learn that she was visiting with a friend in another
part of the city, and that she was very ill indeed. I immediately
went to call upon her, and she was very much pleased
to see me, and then I discovered that she had not been in the
country at all, but had been there in the city with her friend.
I could not at the time understand her conduct; but as she, in
common with most other delicate people, was rather capricious,
I allowed it to pass without any comment. She told me that
as soon as she felt a little better she would come and see me;
but she never came, and I was somewhat offended at her supposed
neglect, and thought that before I visited her again I
would wait and see whether she first came up to our house.</p>

<p>All this time, a friend of Carrie’s was in the habit of looking
in very frequently upon some trifling errand or other, and I
noticed that she always waited for the return of my husband,
and then made some excuse to go out with him, and they had
long conversations together. There was some mystery, I
clearly perceived, and as a wife and a woman I determined
that it was my duty to find out what that mystery was.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">TAKING A SECOND WIFE:—THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST.</span></h2>

<p>I did not presume to ask my husband what it was that he had
to talk about with Carrie’s friend, but I instinctively felt what
it might be, and I was so much troubled in mind that I thought
I would never go to see her again.</p>

<p>By that time I had learned, as every Mormon wife does
learn, never to ask questions. The wife of a Saint never
dares to ask her husband whither he is going or when he will
return. She is not expected to know or care what business
her husband may have on hand when he leaves home in the
evening, after making a most elaborate toilet, with frequent
admiration of himself in the mirror. If the poor wife feels
that she <em>must</em> say something, to give vent to her overwrought
feelings, she simply asks in a conscious, guilty way, when he
will be home again; wishing too often in her secret heart
that he might say—Never. Her duty is to be silent and
unobservant; and though some poor women have, when their
outraged feelings were overcharged, inadvertently betrayed
curiosity respecting the movements of the absent ones, they
have soon been sternly taught their duty, and those loving
husbands have given them good cause to repent of their inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>And who can blame these disconsolate, lonely women, if
thus they feel? Their religion alone is to blame. It has
been the destruction of that sweet confidence which should
exist between husband and wife, and it has divided hearts and
interests which should inseparably have been for ever one.
This, slowly but no less painfully, I was beginning to understand.
However earnestly I might try to combat the idea,
my life was wretched with the one continual fear of what I
might see or hear of my husband. I tried to drive away such
thoughts, and I called to mind all the acts of kindness and
devotion which he had shown to those whose love my heart held
dear. Sometimes, arguing with myself, I said: “No, <em>my</em> husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
will not deceive <em>me</em>; no matter what other men may do or be
with their wives, <em>my</em> husband will be frank and true with me.”</p>

<p>So I thought then; but I was destined to realize in my own
experience how utterly impossible it is for any man, no matter
how honest and truthful he may naturally be, to practise
Polygamy without becoming a hypocrite; and the more he
loves his wife the greater hypocrite he will become, trying to
deceive her with the foolish notion that half his cruelty is
done in attempting to “spare her feelings.”</p>

<p>My husband thought that he was acting kindly to me when
he said nothing of all that transpired between him and Carrie;
but when I saw the visit of Carrie’s lady-friend so frequently
repeated, I began to suspect the truth, and was much troubled.
I was, however, too proud to question him on the subject, at
the risk of getting an evasive answer, and it was evident that
the two persons most intimately interested in the matter
intended that I should be kept in the dark. I saw through
all this, and it did not tend either to restore my peace of mind
or to make me more pleasant in my intercourse with Carrie
or my husband. In their conduct I could see nothing but
deception, however good their intention might be, and I felt
that they were treating me as a child. The thought was very
painful to me, and it was only with a great effort that I suppressed
it.</p>

<p>These painful feelings, of course, had a marked effect upon
my daily life. I grew weary, and my health failed, I became
thin, and my features were marked with care and anxiety.
When people came to see me, I said little to them, and their
very presence I felt irksome. Mechanically I went through
the daily routine of duty, but my heart was in nothing that I
did. I dared not even trust myself to speak to any one, for
fear of becoming the subject of conversation and attracting
the attention of the authorities, which was not at all desirable,
for the position of a “rebellious woman” in those days was
anything but pleasant. I stood alone. Upon my husband I
looked with suspicion; my children were too young to understand
me; Carrie—whom I had taken to my heart, to whom I
had confided my sorrows, whose own welfare had been so dear
to me—had, as I thought, turned against me, like an adder,
and there was no one in whom I could trust. It seemed to
me too cruel for Carrie to treat me so, and yet I could not
doubt that she was acting unfaithfully towards me.</p>

<p>Surrounded by my children, living under the same roof
with my husband, my heart was, nevertheless, filled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
sense of utter loneliness and desolation. There was no one
in whom I could confide, to whom I might tell my sorrows,
and from whose counsel or strength I might derive comfort.
I dared not even go and lay my griefs before God, for I had
been led to believe that all my suffering was caused by an
arbitrary decree which He willed to be enforced. How false
a notion of that loving heavenly Father whose tender care is
so manifestly shown in His gentle dealings with the weakest of
His creatures!</p>

<p>It was now about six months since Carrie left my house,
and I was under the impression that all that time certain
well-intentioned sisters had been doing all they could to bring
about a marriage between her and my husband. Her health,
however, was so bad that sometimes for weeks together she
did not leave her room. At the time, of course, I knew
nothing of this, but I afterwards heard of it. When I called
upon her, which I did when I found that she was too ill to
come to see me, I thought she was greatly changed in her
manner; but when I thought of her lonely position, my heart
warmed towards her, and I forgot all my suspicions. Certainly,
I wanted to ask her one plain question relative to my
husband, but my pride would not allow me to speak to her on
that subject unless she first mentioned it to me. One day I
thought that she was about to make a confession. Talking
indifferently of ordinary matters, she suddenly said, “I am
surprised you ever wished to see me;” but when I asked her
why, expecting that she would now explain what had so long
troubled me, she answered evasively, and nothing more was said.</p>

<p>With Carrie’s absence from our house the rumours about
her which had troubled me so much somewhat subsided.
Nothing could silence the secret apprehension which continually
held my soul in dread; but the fear of my young friend’s influence
once removed, I was comparatively at peace. It was,
however, but the lull before the storm. I soon learned that
in losing Carrie I did not lose Polygamy, and from about that
time I can date my husband’s desire to sustain his brethren in
the performance of their duty, and his wish to act as they did,
especially in reference to the “Celestial Order of Heaven.”
Just at that time the “Morrill Bill” for the suppression of
Polygamy was presented to Congress, and all true Mormons
were made to feel that it was their duty to stand by their
leader; and though, in itself, they might see nothing desirable
in Polygamy, yet, if they had not already multiplied wives, it
was their duty to do so without any delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Ever watchful as I was, I noticed little changes in my
husband, which under ordinary circumstances would have
escaped my observation. By this time one all-absorbing idea
had taken possession of my mind, and my husband’s thoughts,
I believe, were turned in the same direction—only our wishes
did not exactly coincide. Polygamy was the thought common
to both, but upon its desirability we entertained dissimilar
views.</p>

<p>A man with Polygamy upon his mind was then a creature
which I did not understand, and which I had not fully studied.
Some years later, when I had a little more experience in Mormonism,
I discovered several never-failing signs by which
one might know when a man wished to take another wife.
He would suddenly “awaken to a sense of his duties;” he would
have serious misgivings as to whether the Lord would pardon
his neglect in not living up to his privileges; he would become
very religious, and would attend to his meetings—his “testimony
meetings,” singing meetings, and all sorts of other
“meetings,” which seemed just then to be very numerous,
and in various other ways he would show his anxiety to live
up to his religion. He would thus be frequently absent from
home, which, of course, “he deeply regrets,” as “he loves so
dearly the society of his wife and children.” The wife, perhaps,
poor simple soul! thinks that he is becoming unusually
loving and affectionate, for he used not, at one time, to express
much sorrow at leaving her alone for a few hours; and she
thinks how happy she ought to feel that such a change has
come over her husband, although, to be sure, he was always
as good as most of the other Mormon men.</p>

<p>My husband was a good and consistent Mormon, and very
much like the rest of his brethren in these matters; and the
brethren, knowing themselves how he felt, sympathized with
him, and urged him on, and, by every means in their power,
aided him in his noble attempts to carry out “the commands
of God!”</p>

<p>One evening, when he came home, he seemed pre-occupied,
as if some matter of importance were troubling his mind.
This set me thinking, too. I saw that he wanted to say something
to me, and I waited patiently. “I am going to the ball,”
he presently remarked, “and I am going alone, for Brother
Brigham wishes me to meet him there.” I knew at once
what was passing in his mind, and dared not question him.
He went and saw Brigham. What passed between them I
do not know; but, when my husband returned, he intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to me that it had been arranged that he should take another
wife.</p>

<p>The idea that some day another wife would be added to our
household was ever present in my mind, but, somehow, when
the fact was placed before me in so many unmistakable
words, my heart sank within me, and I shrank from the
realization that <em>our</em> home was at last to be desecrated by the
foul presence of Polygamy.</p>

<p>Almost fainting, now that the truth came home to me in all
its startling reality, I asked my husband when he proposed to
take his second wife.</p>

<p>“Immediately,” he replied; “that is to say, as soon as I
can.”</p>

<p>We were silent for some time. My mind was troubled.
Had I been able to consider the whole affair as an outrage
upon humanity in general, and an insult to my sex in particular,
I should have replied with scorn and defiance. Had I
implicitly believed in the divinity of the Revelation, I should
have bowed my head in meek submission. But I did neither
of these. The feelings of my heart naturally led me to hate
with a most perfect hatred the very mention of the word
Polygamy, while at the same time I still believed, or tried to
make myself believe, that the Revelation was from God, and
must therefore be obeyed. Such was the strange and contradictory
position in which I was placed.</p>

<p>“Are you not satisfied that it is right for me to take another
wife?” my husband asked.</p>

<p>“I have never yet really doubted that the Revelation was
from God,” I replied, “for I cannot believe that any man would
be so blasphemous and wicked as to set forth such a revelation
in God’s name, unless he received it as he said he did. If
it is from God, of course you are right to obey it; but if I
were to consult my own feelings I would never consent to live
in Polygamy. I would rather risk salvation, and tell the Lord
that He had placed upon me a burden heavier that I was able
to bear, and that I regarded Him as a hard taskmaster. But
when the salvation of my husband and children, to say nothing
of my own, is at stake, my wishes and happiness go for
nothing, and I can only consent.”</p>

<p>From that moment I felt like a condemned criminal for
whom there was not a shadow of hope or a chance of escape.
Could I possibly have looked upon the sacred obligations of
marriage as lightly as Mormonism taught me to regard them,
I believe I should have broken every tie and risked the consequences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
But I had vowed to be faithful unto death, and if
this second marriage was for my husband’s welfare, and for the
salvation of us and of our children, I resolved to make the
effort to subdue my rebellious heart, or die in the attempt.
For the first time in my life, I thanked God that I was not a
man, and that the salvation of my family did not depend upon
me; for if fifty revelations had commanded it, I could not have
taken the responsibility of withering one loving, trusting
heart. I felt that if such laws were given to us, our woman’s
nature ought to have been adapted to them, so that submission
to them might be as much a pleasure to us as it was to the
men, and that we might at least feel that we were justly dealt
with.</p>

<p>Not long after this, my husband brought me a message
from Eliza R. Snow. She wanted me to take tea with her, and
he urged me to accept the invitation. I did not want to go,
for I knew too well her object in sending for me. She had
been talking with my husband about me, I felt sure, and that
was how she came to send the message by him. I went, however,
and, as I anticipated, she wanted to talk with me about
Polygamy, and to try to convince me that it was for our best
interests that my husband should take another wife, and that
it was quite time he did so.</p>

<p>I told her that he was not yet in a position to do so. “We
have quite a family,” I said, “and I think he should at least be
allowed to wait until he has accumulated a little before he
embarrasses himself with new responsibilities.”</p>

<p>“And where would the kingdom of God be,” she asked, “if
we had all talked in this way? Let your husband take more
wives, and let them help him, and you will feel blessed in
keeping the commands of God.”</p>

<p>“There would be no good in my husband taking another
wife,” I said, “while I feel as I do now. To be acceptable to
the Lord, a sacrifice should be made willingly and in a proper
spirit, and I do not think that under present circumstances it
is proper for him to do this thing.”</p>

<p>“Let him be the judge of that,” she replied; “do not seek
to control him; he alone is responsible, and therefore let him
do as he thinks best.”</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “he himself does not want another wife yet.”
But I spoke with hesitation, for my heart misgave me.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” she answered; “your husband is a very
good man, and desires to live his religion, and it is a great grief
to him to know that you feel as you do, and you really must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
try to overcome your opposition. If you had a loaf of bread
to make, and you made it, and it was pronounced good, do you
think it would be of the slightest consequence what feelings
agitated your mind while you were making it, so long as it was
well made? So it is with the Lord. He does not care with
what feelings you give your husband another wife, so long as
you do so.”</p>

<p>This was a miserable attempt at reasoning, to say nothing
of its falsity; and notwithstanding all she said, I still felt that
no blessing would ever attend an unwilling sacrifice, and I
told her so. She spoke to me very kindly, however, and tried
to encourage me, and suggested that Carrie would be a very
proper person for my husband to marry. I had now no longer
any doubt in my mind that it had been all “arranged,” and that
opposition on my part would be all in vain. I was indignant
at this, for I believed that, as the Revelation itself said, I—the
first wife—ought first to have been consulted. This, however,
I subsequently found was as false as the system itself.</p>

<p>I returned home, pondering over what had been said to me,
with a feeling of intense weariness oppressing my heart. I
did not know what to think. It appeared to me that every
one had determined that Carrie should be my husband’s second
wife; and I now believed, with my talkative friend, that
Brigham Young had certainly intended it from the beginning.
I felt that I would rather that he should marry almost any one
else than her; for I felt certain that I should hate any woman
whom he might marry, no matter how much I might have
loved her before.</p>

<p>But my mind was soon relieved of its trouble respecting
poor Carrie; for, as I before mentioned, her failing health forbade
all thoughts of marriage, and my husband, after a short
time, never spoke to me about her. The real cause of my
distress, however, was by no means removed; it was determined,
without appeal, that my husband should, notwithstanding
any impediment to the contrary, take another wife,
whoever that chosen one might be. My apprehensions, therefore,
were not removed; they were only turned in another
direction.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="smaller">TRIALS—THE SECOND WIFE CHOSEN—SHADOWS OF LIFE.</span></h2>

<p>It is a custom among the Mormon married men—those at
least who make any pretensions to doing what is right, and
who wish to spare the feelings of their wives as much as the
degrading system will allow—to make it appear as if the
second wife were chosen by the first, and they go through the
form of consulting with her as to who shall be selected. The
husband will mention the names of several eligible young
ladies, among whom is sure to be the one upon whom he has
already set his affections. If the wife should try to make
herself agreeable by suggesting one or another of these young
ladies, some objection is sure to be raised. One is too thoughtless;
the relations of another are not quite so agreeable as
they might be; and the temper of a third is said to be not
very good. In this way, one after another is taken off the list,
until only one remains—the bright particular star of whom
all along the husband has been thinking—and if the wife
should make any objections to <em>this</em> one, the husband, of course,
has a ready answer. In most cases her extreme youth is an
excuse for everything; she will have plenty of time to learn,
and will be the more ready to be taught.</p>

<p>When once they have obtained the reluctant consent of
their wives, it is astonishing how bright and cheerful these
Mormon husbands become. Notwithstanding all that they
have said to the contrary, it is evident that Polygamy is no
trial to <em>their</em> faith. They say that it is as great a cross to
them as it is to their wives, but somehow or other they take
very kindly to it.</p>

<p>It was soon settled who should be the honoured maiden to
whom my husband should pay his addresses. Her name was
Belinda, and she was the daughter of the Apostle Parley
P. Pratt. I of course was not expected to ask any questions
or evince any curiosity respecting the girl or my husband’s
relations towards her. I had given my consent, I had acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
my part, or at least all the part that was expected of me; I had
fulfilled my duty as a Mormon first wife when I agreed to
another wife being taken; and, henceforth, all that transpired
was—so the Elders would have said—no business of mine.</p>

<p>My husband’s intended certainly was very young—almost
too young for a bride she would have been considered in any
other community—and I must in fairness allow that she was
very handsome. It is of the utmost importance that a Mormon
girl should marry young. Women everywhere are never
anxious to grow old, but among the Mormons age is especially
dreaded by the women; for when years have robbed them of
their personal attractions, in most cases they lose all hold upon
their husbands’ affections, and find themselves obliged to give
place to prettier and more youthful rivals. A woman’s position
in the world to come, as I have before mentioned, depends,
so the Elders say, very much upon the number of children she
has borne in this; it is, therefore, a consideration of the very
first importance that she should marry as early in life as possible,
and this obligation is never for a moment overlooked by
the refined and pure-minded Mormon men.</p>

<p>And now began the “painful task” of wooing the young
lady. My husband told me that it was “a very painful duty,”
and as an obedient wife I felt bound to believe him. It was,
of course, no pleasure to him to pay his addresses to an interesting
young girl; it was no anxiety to be with her which
made him hasten away to the damsel’s house of an evening.
Oh, dear, no! it was pure principle, love for the kingdom of
God, and “a very <em>painful</em> task!” He seemed, however, to
bear it remarkably well, and manifested a zeal which was perfectly
astonishing to me, considering the circumstances. In
fact, I felt it my duty to restrain him a little for the sake of his
health, for he seemed so anxious to perform his “task” properly
that he could scarcely spare time to take his meals; but,
regardless of his own feelings, he did not pay much attention
to my suggestions.</p>

<p>But, deeply as I sympathized with my husband, there were
times when I felt that mine was indeed no imaginary sorrow,
and that nothing could lull the storm that had gathered in my
breast. The affliction which I had so long dreaded was now
right at my door, and the most painful feelings agitated my
mind. Sometimes I shut myself up in my own room and tried
to reason with myself; then I would kneel, and pray, and weep
with passionate emotion; and again I would pace the floor,
my heart overflowing with anger and indignation. I never, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
that time, knew what it was to be happy, for I felt that I was a
burden and hindrance to my husband, and I longed to die. I
had loved him so devotedly that I could not even now cast
him from my heart, and, though I felt bitterly my position, I
believed that he would not willingly wound me, and that he
was acting from the purest of motives. But it was all in vain.
I could not change my nature, and my heart would rebel.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me to tell the thousand annoyances
and indignities to which I was forced to submit—trials
which might appear too trifling even to name, but which to
a wife, under such circumstances, were crosses which she
found it hard enough to bear. My husband knew nothing of
these things, and, had he done so, it is more than probable that
he would have considered it weakness in me to be troubled
about matters of such small consequence—little actions and
foolish words which he would have said I ought to have treated
with contempt. It was easy to say that, but not so easy to do.
Let any wife picture to herself how she would feel, if, after
schooling her heart to submission, after realizing that she was
no longer to be first and dearest in her husband’s affections,
she were to be constantly hearing the friends and relations of
the young girl to whom her husband was engaged, boasting of
his devotion to her, and openly expressing their belief that he
had never loved before! How would any wife be pleased if,
whenever her husband’s intended received a valuable present
from him, she were particularly informed of the fact, and a
thousand little aggravating details were added to make her, if
possible, more miserable?</p>

<p>A woman can nerve herself to endure almost anything, and
outwardly she may conceal her feelings, but there are limits
beyond which endurance is not possible. A chance meeting
with the girl who has superseded her in her husband’s love,—or
worse still, should she chance to surprise the affectionate couple
<i lang="fr">tête-á-tête</i>,—is sufficient to dispel all her good resolutions and
to destroy that tranquillity of mind which she finds it so
difficult to preserve. She becomes sick at heart, nervous, and
entirely unfitted for her duties. I have frequently heard Mormon
women say that, notwithstanding their husbands had been
for many years polygamists, they could never see the other
wives without a feeling of anger and indignation arising in
their hearts. I know that in my own case I never became
reconciled to the system.</p>

<p>My husband was called away to the Eastern States upon
business, and his marriage was postponed. I thought that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
present would be a good time to show her some little attentions,
which I believed it was my duty to do. The idea of
coming in contact with her was certainly not at all pleasant;
but I felt that it was only right for me to act in a friendly
manner towards her, however painful it might be. She was
the cause of much sorrow to me, but I could not blame her,
for she had been born and brought up in the system, and, of
course, supposed it true.</p>

<p>Belinda was a very nice girl, and, under other circumstances,
I believe I should have liked her very much. I looked upon
her as little more than a child, and my husband has frequently
told me that he also regarded her in that light; but to me it
was of small consequence that he thought of her as a child,
so long as he acted towards her as a woman. Now that he
was away from home, there was no danger that she would meet
him, so I invited her in a friendly way to call upon me. She
came, and I had one or two other ladies present, for I was not
like my husband in that particular—<em>I</em> had no anxiety to be
alone with her. My effort to cultivate a friendly feeling
towards her was not very successful. There was a coldness
and restraint on both sides which we could not overcome, and
I felt not a little relief when the evening was over. Subsequently
I renewed the attempt, but to no purpose; her very
presence in my house, and among my children, seemed in itself
an insult to me.</p>

<p>During my husband’s absence my poor friend Carrie Grant
had been daily growing worse in health. I had once asked
my husband if there was any truth in the rumours that I had
heard of his attachment to her, but he had assured me that
there was no foundation for them.</p>

<p>Poor Carrie! Hers was a short and unhappy life; even
her little dream of love was overclouded by disappointment.
She was now constantly confined to her room, and whenever
it was possible I used to call upon her, and attempted to make
her feel more happy and cheerful. She used to ask me to talk
with her about Mormonism. “You know,” she said, “that I
have never known any other religion, and I believe that this
is right, though it does not make me happy. My father loved
Mormonism so much that I feel it <em>must</em> be right; the fault is in
my own evil nature, that does not bend to the will of Heaven.”</p>

<p>One day she said to me: “I am getting worse, Sister
Stenhouse, and I am glad of it, for I shall die. I am of no
good here—there is nothing for me to do; if I lived, I should
only cause trouble; it is better as it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Carrie,” I said, “you must not talk like that. You are
still very young, and probably will live for many years, and you
do not know what future may lie before you.”</p>

<p>“Do not blame me too much,” she replied, “for I am not
the only unhappy girl in the city. I know many girls who
are very miserable. Married women think that they are the
only ones who suffer, while we girls know that nowhere upon
the face of the earth can be found such an unhappy set as we
are. Why did Brigham Young keep me from going to my
friends in the East? I should have been happier then; I
should have felt better. But now I want to die, and I am
weary waiting for death.”</p>

<p>In this melancholy mood I found her one day, when she
appeared particularly sad. She had been ill then about ten
months; but her loving blue eyes were just as bright as ever,
and I could see very little change in her, except that she was
not able now to leave her couch without assistance, and she
spoke as if it fatigued her very much. It was quite impossible
to arouse her from the state of melancholy into which she
had fallen, and it seemed to me that she could not last long.
I offered to take her to my house, and said I would nurse her
there and take care of her; but she said she was very kindly
treated by her father’s family, and did not wish to change.
She seemed to cling to me as if she could not bear that I
should leave her, and she told me she had something on her
mind that troubled her; she wanted to have a long talk with
me about it, but not that day, she said.</p>

<p>As the end was fast approaching, she one day said: “I want
to tell you now, Sister Stenhouse, what I spoke of before, if
you are willing to listen and will not be angry with anything
I say. Remember, I am dying, or I never would speak to you
as I am going to.”</p>

<p>I told her of my great love for her, and that nothing that
she could say would change that love.</p>

<p>“You do not know what I want to ask you, or you would
not say so,” she replied; “and I so dread to lose your love that
I am afraid to tell you what is in my mind. But you know
that I am dying, and you will not be very hard with me.”</p>

<p>She was then silent for some time, as if too much fatigued
to continue the conversation. “No, I cannot tell you to-day,”
she said at last; “I want you to love me one day longer.”</p>

<p>I urged her not to doubt that my love towards her could
never change, and told her that it was better for her to speak
at once and relieve her mind. She took my hand, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
long and tenderly at me, and then she said: “I will tell you
all; and if your love can stand that test, then indeed you <em>do</em>
love me.”</p>

<p>I encouraged her, and she began: “Would you hate me if
I told you that I loved your husband?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “I would not hate you, Carrie.” I said
no more, for it seemed to me that it would be wrong of me
to tell her of my suspicions, and all that I had suffered at
the thought that my husband had conceived an affection for
her.</p>

<p>“Can you possibly answer me as calmly as that?” she
said. “I thought that the very mention of such a thing would
almost kill you, for I saw how much you loved your husband,
and, ah! how I have suffered at the thought of telling you!
But that is not all I wanted to say, or I need never have
spoken to you at all. I wanted to ask you to do me one last
kindness, and then I think I shall die happy. You know that
we have been taught that Polygamy is absolutely necessary
to salvation, and if I were to die without being sealed to some
man I could not possibly enter the celestial kingdom. My
friends wished me to be sealed to one of the authorities of the
Church, but I cannot bear the idea of being sealed to a man
whom I do not love. I love your husband, and I want you to
promise that I shall be sealed to him. If I had thought
that I should recover, I never would have let you know this,
for I would not live to give you sorrow. But, when I am
gone, will you kneel by your husband’s side in the Endowment
House, and be married to him for me? Will it pain you much
to do that for me, Sister Stenhouse?”</p>

<p>I felt so strangely as I listened to all this, that I could not
utter a single word, and she continued: “We shall then be
together in eternity, and I am happy at the thought of that,
for I think I love you even better than I love him. And then
I believe we shall have overcome all our earthly feelings and
shall be prepared to live that celestial law, and perhaps we
may prefer it, for no doubt we shall know no unhappiness
there.”</p>

<p>The exertion of talking seemed to be too much for her, and
she remained silent for some time. I felt ashamed that I had
allowed my feelings to influence me at such a moment, for
while she had been speaking I had allowed my thoughts to
travel back over the past year; and now that she admitted her
love for my husband, very many circumstances came painfully
to my recollection and confirmed all that she said. I resolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
however, not to question her, but to allow her to tell me just
what she pleased. So I knelt down by her side and whispered
into her ear a solemn promise that I would do all that she
desired. Poor girl! how I felt for her! When I had given
her this pledge, she appeared much relieved and told me freely
all that had passed between my husband and herself, and she
said she had left my house simply because she could not endure
to cause me any sorrow. I told her of my husband’s contemplated
marriage with Belinda Pratt, and she appeared a
good deal troubled at it. “Let me be second,” she said,
“for then I shall feel that I am nearer to you, and I want
you always to think that, when you die, if I have the power,
I shall be the first to meet you and take you by the hand.”</p>

<p>Thus we talked together for a long time, and it was with
painful interest that I listened to what she said. It was a
singular interview—a wife receiving from a young girl the
confession that she loved her husband; that he had fully
returned her affection, and had even talked with her about
marriage; the girl requesting the wife to be married for her
to her own husband; and the wife, full of tender love towards
the girl, freely giving her a promise that she would do so. In
my sorrow at parting from her, and the great affection that I
felt towards her, all feelings of jealousy were utterly forgotten.
Before I left I said: “Carrie, whether you live or die, you
shall be married to my husband, if he ever enters into
Polygamy; and I say this although I do not doubt that he
will do so, and at the same time I think that you will
live.”</p>

<p>I really believed that she might recover; for now this
burden was off her mind, I thought she would have strength
to subdue her sickness, and at first it seemed as if this would
really be the case. The next day she appeared so much
better that her friends all became hopeful, and when I told
her that I had written to my husband and had told him, that
since he had made up his mind to go into Polygamy, I wished
him to marry her, she appeared so happy, and showed her
joy in so many innocent ways, that I could not be angry.</p>

<p>“How do you think he will feel,” she said, “when he
gets your letter? Do I look pretty well to-day? And do
you think that if I continue to get better I shall have regained
my looks before he comes home?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said, humouring her, “you will look quite pretty
by the time he returns; I shall be really jealous of you.”</p>

<p>In an instant the thought of how much all mention of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
in connexion with my husband must be painful to me,
occurred to her mind, and she begged me to forgive her for
her carelessness. “No,” said she, “I will try never to give
you pain, and you must always love me.”</p>

<p>For some days this improvement in her appearance continued,
and I thought and hoped that we should soon have
her round again. I really wished her to live now, for if it
was absolutely necessary that Mr. Stenhouse <em>must</em> practise
Polygamy, I would prefer that, rather than any other woman,
he should marry her, for I felt that she would understand
me as no one else could.</p>

<p>Thus, after all, I really had selected a second wife for my
husband!</p>

<p>But the change in poor Carrie’s looks was altogether deceptive.
News came to me one morning that she was very
much worse, and I hastened to see her. As I entered
the room, her eyes brightened, and she said: “I am
glad that you have come, Sister Stenhouse, for I feel that I
am going soon.” Then, after a pause, she added, holding up
her hands—“Do you know what that means?” The fingernails
were turning blue.</p>

<p>“That means death,” she said; “and it is better so.”</p>

<p>After this we conversed together for some time upon
various topics of special interest to her in the position in
which she then was, and presently she said, as if asking a
question, “You will keep your promise, I know.”</p>

<p>“Carrie,” I answered, “if there is anything that I can say
or do that will make you feel more certain that I will keep
my promise, if I live to do so, tell me, and I will do it.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” she said, “that, after all, he never loved
me. He pitied my lonely situation and was so kind and good
to me, that I learned to love him, and those meddlesome sisters
tried to get him to marry me, but I would not be false to you.
Then we both thought it was best not to tell you, as it would
make you grieve, although it never could take place. Even
now, had I not known that I was dying, I never would have
told you. But you will not love me less when you think of
me after I am gone?”</p>

<p>I told her that my affection for her would never change,
and I talked with her, and tried to soothe her dying moments,
and to make her feel less lonely; and thus the morning passed
away. In the afternoon she was silent and apparently unconscious,
and before another day dawned she had passed away to
her rest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">MARRIAGE FOR THE DEAD—ENTERING INTO POLYGAMY—THE
NEW WIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The following evening I went round again to the house, to
gaze once more at the form of my dear friend. She was lying
in her coffin, dressed for the grave, and I looked at her long
and tenderly as she rested sleeping there. Her features were
peaceful and natural as if in slumber; an expression of calm
tranquillity hovered around her countenance, and in the repose
of death she seemed almost happy. Poor girl! her life had
been short indeed, and she had known but little pleasure; but
I believed that she was now beyond the reach of earthly
sorrow and earthly disappointment, happy in that land where
suffering and tears are all unknown. “There shall be no night
there,” the Lord of that other life had said. Sorrow and sighing
shall flee away from that bright and glorious land; and
the grief and pain, which on earth are the portion of so many
tried and weary hearts, shall find no entrance into that eternal
rest which our Father in heaven has prepared for us beyond
the floods of death.</p>

<p>Oh, better far! I thought, it is that thus she should pass
away. True, she has seen but little of life, and has not tasted
many of its joys; but, as a compensation, how much has she been
spared! She was so gentle and so sensitive, so unfit to battle
with the stern realities of existence, that I felt she had gained
rather than lost in being taken away in the morning of her
life.</p>

<p>I now expected very soon to be called upon to undergo the
most painful ordeal that any wife can be required to pass
through: I was to give my husband another wife—such is the
sacrifice demanded of every Mormon woman.</p>

<p>The thought of doing this was worse than death to me. I
felt injured, humiliated and degraded by it, and yet I still tried
to believe that it was the will of God, and must therefore be
right. To me, this outrage upon all the purest feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
womanhood seemed more like the will of men—men of the
basest and most unholy passions. It was repulsive to me in
whatever form it was presented, but still I reproached my own
rebellious heart for feeling so, for I had been told that the
ways of the Lord were past finding out, and, however unlike
Him this Revelation might appear, we Mormon women had
been taught that it was our duty to bend our wills and to
suffer in unquestioning and uncomplaining silence.</p>

<p>As the time approached, I felt like a condemned criminal
awaiting the day of execution. A sense of apprehension, a
dread of coming evil, was ever present to my mind, and everything
appeared to me through the medium of my griefs. To
a certain extent, my husband also suffered, for it would be
impossible, I think, for any man to see his wife suffering so
intensely without feeling for her, and I sometimes believed
that his sympathy for me was so great, that, if he had dared,
he would even then have refused to obey the counsel of the
Priesthood.</p>

<p>Then, too, he had a little trouble of his own, for he began
to realize that this innovation upon the sanctity of our home
would make a great change in his future—his freedom would
be gone.</p>

<p>However gratifying it may be to a man’s feelings to know
that there is no limit to his privileges, and that he is always
at liberty—no matter how many wives he may already possess—to
fall in love with every pretty girl he meets, and marry
her if she consents; yet every intelligent man must be conscious
that it can be no easy matter to keep peace between
many wives in one house, and that, if he wishes to act rightly
by all, he must train himself to be scrupulously just, never showing
any partiality in look or deed, or even by a word. There are
many such men among the Mormons. They are conscientious
and good men, who try to live their religion, but who at the
same time desire to act kindly towards their wives. My husband
began to realize the great responsibility that he was
about to take upon himself, and, seeing his thoughtful and
troubled look, I tried to hide my own feelings; for every true
wife knows that nothing so powerfully arouses a woman to
struggle with her own sorrows as the knowledge that her husband
is unhappy.</p>

<p>The dreaded day at length arrived, the day which for so
long, and with such painful forebodings, I had anticipated. I
had spent a very wakeful and unhappy night, and felt very
sick and nervous, for I was about to become a mother, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
health was anything but strong. I hardly felt as if I should
have courage to go through that day. I was, however, compelled
to nerve myself to the task, and I began to make my
preparations for going to the Endowment House. The only
thing that gave me strength was the thought that my husband
had consented that I should go through the ceremony of being
married to him that day for Carrie; for even then I supposed
that those who would be married in heaven must first be married
on earth, and that, too, by those who had received authority
from on high.</p>

<p>Ever since I had first embraced Mormonism I had been entirely
cut off from Gentile society, although living in the
Gentile world. Abroad, and also when in New York, the
cares of a family kept me very much at home, and the continual
state of apprehension in which I was rendered me averse
to visiting among friends. Thus it was that I never conversed
freely with any one who could have informed me truthfully of
the origin of Mormonism, and consequently I brooded over
my religion as a melancholy fact; but, though with moments
of weakness and wavering, I never thoroughly doubted its
divine origin. The terrible sacrifice which was about to be
required of me might, I thought, be painful to make, but it
was no less the will of God. I must submit, whatever the
effort might cost me.</p>

<p>The morning was bright and lovely—a morning calculated
to inspire happy hopes and pleasant feelings; but to me it
brought nothing but fear and trembling. Even the innocent
prattle of my children annoyed me, and they, not knowing how
deeply I was suffering, looked at me with wonder in their eyes.
Oh, I thought, surely my husband will at length comprehend
the greatness of the love I bear him? surely he will now appreciate
the sacrifice I make for his sake and for my religion?
Even now, if I did not know that he believes this doctrine to
be true, and he would feel condemned if, through any opposition
of mine, he were not allowed to practise it, I would at the
last moment dash this bitter cup from my lips and take my
chance of the consequences in a future state!</p>

<p>Utterly cast down and broken-hearted, I felt almost as if
the Lord Himself had forsaken me, and there was no one to
whom I could look for aid. I could not go to my husband in
that hour for sympathy; for I well knew that his thoughts
must be with his intended bride, and that my sorrows would
only trouble him at a time when he must desire to be at
peace. Besides which, I was too proud to plead for love at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
shrine that I felt should rightfully be all my own. And then,
too, I knew not but what he might tell <em>her</em> of my feelings;
and it would be too great a humiliation for me should she
think me jealous of the position which she now occupied, and
her influence over my husband.</p>

<p>With such feelings I went to the Endowment House. There
at the altar I was to give proof of my obedience and of my
faith in my religion, by placing the hand of the new wife in
that of my husband. The thought was almost madness. To
have followed my husband to the grave would have been a
terrible blow to me, but to live to see him the husband of
another woman was something that seemed to me beyond endurance.
Notwithstanding every effort of faith, doubts would
arise, and in bitterest anguish I thought—this is more like
the work of cruel man than of God. Why should man have
this power over woman, and she so helpless? Surely a just
and impartial God can have nothing to do with this! There
was a darkness before my eyes, and, struggle as I might, I
could see no ray of light—no glimmering of hope.</p>

<p>First, my husband was married to Miss Pratt; and then to
me for Carrie! Thus I fulfilled my pledge to my departed
friend. I had found, before going to the Endowment House,
that I could not have Carrie sealed to my husband next to
me, for Belinda had objected, and her mother had appealed
to Brigham Young about it. They told me that he had said
that the living had claims before the dead, although my own
feelings would have led me to think otherwise. Brigham
Young performed the ceremony. He sat at the end of the
altar and we three knelt down—my husband on one side, and
Miss Pratt and myself on the other. Speaking to me, Brigham
Young asked: “Are you willing to give this woman to your
husband to be his lawful wife for time and for all eternity?
If you are, you will signify it by placing her right hand within
the right hand of your husband.”</p>

<p>I did so; but what words can describe my feelings? The
anguish of a whole lifetime was crowded into that one single
moment. The painful meaning of those words, “for all eternity,”
withered my soul, and the unending contract which
my husband had made with another woman was practically a
divorce from me. I had now laid everything upon the altar
of sacrifice, for I had given away my husband. What more
could the Lord require of me that I was not prepared to do?</p>

<p class="caption">THE CRISIS OF A LIFE—ENTERING INTO POLYGAMY.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 296.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I was bewildered and almost beside myself, and yet I had
to hide my feelings. Hope was for ever banished from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
life. To whom could I look for sympathy among those who
were around me? They were most of them men who had
ruthlessly wrecked the lives and lacerated the hearts of hundreds
of women before my turn came, and the sight of an
unhappy wife was so common in their experience that it was
more likely to awaken their anger than their pity. I felt this
instinctively, and I resolved that they should never know how
much my poor heart was torn. My husband, it is true, was
there. <em>My</em> husband! Was he not now the husband of another
woman, and therefore no longer belonging to me? I
knew that I never could overcome my early teaching sufficiently
to <em>feel</em> that this was right, though such was my
wretched fanaticism that I mentally and verbally assented to
it. I felt that now I stood alone—our union was severed,
there could never be any copartnership between that other
wife and myself—no, never! Salvation or no salvation, it was
impossible that I could ever love her. From that day I began
to hide all my sorrows from my husband, and it was but very
seldom that I uttered a word of discontent, and when I expressed
what I felt, it was in anger; but never in sorrow
seeking sympathy.</p>

<p>I remember when we returned home—that home which had
now lost its charm, for the young wife was to live there—my
husband said to me: “You have been very brave, but it is
not so hard to bear, after all, is it?” I had hidden my feelings
so well that he really thought that I was indifferent.
But during the remainder of the day, how I watched their looks
and noticed every word! To me their tender tones were
daggers, piercing my heart and filling me with a desire to revenge
myself upon the father of my children. Oh, what
fanatics we Mormon women have been ever to have believed
for a single moment that a just and loving Father and God
would have given a command that in almost every instance
has produced such fearful results upon those who should have
been happy wives and mothers, and consequently upon their
children! Indeed, even then it made me feel that there was
no justice in heaven, if this love which is the best part of
woman’s nature—this love that we had always believed was a
part of divinity itself—this principle, without which there
would be nothing worth living for—if this was to be our
greatest curse, and the woman who showed herself most
actuated by this gentle influence was to be the greatest
victim.</p>

<p>I felt that day that if I could not get away by myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
alone and give expression to my overcharged feelings, I
should certainly lose my reason. I was utterly miserable.
It was only in the dead of night, in my own chamber, that
I gave way to the terrible anguish that was consuming me.
God and my own soul can alone bear witness to what I
suffered in that time of woe. That night was to me such
as even the most God-forsaken might pray never to know;
and morning dawned without my having for a moment closed
my eyes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SAINTS:—POLYGAMY
FROM A WOMAN’S STANDPOINT.</span></h2>

<p>I was now to realize personally, in my own home life, what
Polygamy actually was. Hitherto I had observed how other
women suffered, and how other men treated their wives; but
now the painful reality had come to my own door, and I was to
experience the effects of the system upon myself, and, instead
of noting the conduct of other men, I should be able to observe
the change which Polygamy might work in my own husband.</p>

<p>How little do the Mormon men know what it is in the truest
sense to have <em>a</em> wife, though they have so many “wives” after
their own fashion! Almost imperceptibly to the husband, and
even to the wife herself, a barrier rises between them from the
very day that he marries another woman. It matters not how
much she believes in the doctrine of plural marriage, or how
willing she may be to submit to it, the fact remains the same.
The estrangement begins by her trying to hide from him all
her secret sorrows; for she feels that what has been done cannot
be undone now, and she says: “I cannot change it; neither
would I if I could, because it is the will of God, and I must
bear it; besides, what good will it do to worry my husband
with all my feelings? He cannot help me; and is he not
another woman’s husband?” Then comes, perhaps, the painful
thought, “I have no longer any desire to confide in him.”
Or it may be that she detects some familiarity between her
husband and the other wife; and she feels bitterly towards
both, for, strive as she may, human nature cannot be altogether
crushed out.</p>

<p>That was a time of great misery to me, much as I tried to
control my feelings. Day by day I strove to hide from my
heart even the knowledge of my own unhappiness; and when
I could no longer endure, I would lock myself in my room and
give vent to the anguish that was consuming me. I realized,
however, that this continual conflict of feeling was unfitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
me for my duties. Everything was becoming a trial to me. I
could not bear to be spoken to; the prattle of my children,
that had always been so dear to me, was now discordant to my
feelings; and all their little questionings were irksome. I determined
that this should no longer be the case; I would battle
with my own heart; I would henceforth devote my whole life—worthless
as that life appeared to have become—to the welfare
of my little ones. This was a conclusion that hundreds
of wretched Mormon wives have arrived at; and when this is
the case, there is some hope for them. But many give way to
despair, and go down broken-hearted to their graves.</p>

<p>How terribly these Mormon men deceive themselves! When
peace, or rather quiet, reigns in their homes, they think that the
Spirit of God is there. But it is not so. It is a calm not like
the gentle silence of sleep, but as the painful stillness of death—the
death of the heart’s best affection and all that is worth calling
love. All <em>true</em> love has fled, and indifference has taken its
place. The very children feel it. What do they, what can
they, care about their father, whom they so seldom see?</p>

<p>Some wives, afraid of creating a prejudice against themselves
and of being forsaken altogether, deceive their husbands, and
make them believe that they are satisfied. It must be admitted
that, in acting thus, these wives are not always actuated by a
fear of losing the society or love of their husbands, for, in Polygamy,
love dies a natural death; but it is galling to a woman’s
pride to have it said that she has been cast off for another.
Then, too—and some women would consider this the most important
reason of all—the best provision is usually made for
the home where the husband stops most frequently; and the
wife, if not for her own sake, at least for her children’s, will
be anxious to have a well-provided house. This is only
natural. The “divine” plan has always been worked out in a
very human way.</p>

<p>When a man has several wives, there is, of course, no
necessity for him to stay with an unhappy or mopish one, as
he can always find a more pleasant reception elsewhere. Men
who can really believe that women are satisfied and happy
under such a system must be entirely ignorant of human
nature.</p>

<p>When a man has more than one wife, his affections must of
necessity be divided; he really has no home in the truest sense
of the word; his houses are simply boarding-places. Should
he have all his wives in one house, as is often the case, they
are then all slaves to the system; each one is watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
others, and they know it—trying to discover something that
can be secretly told to the husband to draw away his affections
from the rest. What more miserable position could be
imagined?</p>

<p>There is, however, no fixed principle regulating Mormon
men in the management of their families; every one is at
liberty to do as he thinks best, and scarcely two families are
governed alike. When Salt Lake City was first settled, the
people had to live as best they could, and a man was glad to
get even one roof under which he and all his wives might be
sheltered. Now, when the husband is wealthy, he generally
provides separate homes for his wives. Some wealthy men,
however, still have all their wives and families together.</p>

<p>I have in my mind, as I write, a very prominent Mormon,
who has half-a-dozen wives; and he divides his time among
them after this fashion. The first week he stays with the first
wife; the next week he is with the second; then he goes back
to the first. The fourth week he passes with the third wife;
then he returns for another week to the first. And thus he
continues to give one week to the first wife, and the next to
one of the other five in turn, until he has blessed them all
with his presence. Now, it would at a casual glance appear
that this first wife has by far the largest share of her husband’s
society; but if the truth must be told, it must be
admitted that the husband is not quite so generous as he
appears. The last wife of this good man is a young and pretty
girl, and she lives with the first wife, and thus his devotion to
the latter is rewarded by the presence of the former. Each
of the other wives has one week of his society and attentions
in every eleven—about five weeks apiece of companionship
with their husband in the course of a whole year. Other men
with the same number of wives pass constantly between one
house and another; they can never be found when wanted;
their lives are one eternal round, and they may be said to have
no real abiding place.</p>

<p>In every settlement in Utah, long, low-roofed houses may
be seen with a row of doors and windows alternating. Even
in Salt Lake City, much as it has changed of late years, such
houses may still be found. To every door and window there
is, of course, a wife; and the furniture of her room consists
of a bed, three chairs, and a table. Then, if the man is a very
devout Mormon and wishes to increase his kingdom by adding
another wife to the inhabitants of the long many-doored house,
a waggon-box is so arranged as to form a sleeping apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
for the new comer; or, what is more likely, one of the old
wives is put into the waggon-box, and the new one takes her
place.</p>

<p>A house with two wings is rather a favourite style with those
men, who, to silence their conscience and the priesthood, conclude
to take “just <em>one</em> extra wife,” and no more. The wives,
with their children, occupy, respectively, each a wing; and the
entrance-door opens into a parlour, which serves as a reception-room
for both families. The husband in this case spends
a week on one side of the house and a week on the other,
alternately; and thus, by an impartial division of his attentions,
he preserves peace in his family. A man who is comfortably
off can, of course, arrange his domestic affairs so as to avoid,
as far as is possible, the inconveniences of the system, but a
poor man is forced to submit to circumstances. Many men
have entered into Polygamy, with two, three, and even four
wives, all, with their children, living together under one roof—in
one room—in the most disgraceful and barbarous manner;
but even for this the leaders were really more to blame
than the poor deluded men themselves; for the command to
“Build up the Kingdom!—build up the Kingdom!”—in
other words, take many wives and raise up large families—has
been so constantly and imperatively insisted upon that
good sense and propriety have at last been entirely overlooked.</p>

<p class="caption">POLYGAMY IN HIGH LIFE—THE PROPHET’S MANSION.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 302.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In a very large house, with many wives, there is greater
safety and peace for the husband than in a small house with
only two wives. When there are only two apartments, the
husband, if not in one, is supposed to be in the other, and the
neglected wife frequently expresses her opinion of her rival in
the opposite room in very powerful language. Scenes may
be witnessed in such households which are too shocking to disclose.
Brigham Young was conscious of this when he said
he “would stand no more fighting and scratching around
him”; and yet, in the face of all this, he dares to tell the
people that this is the “Order of <em>Celestial</em> Marriage.” With
many wives living together in a large house there are many
advantages. The whereabouts of the husband is not so easily
discovered, and the unhappy or jealous wife is at a loss to know
upon whom to vent her ire. On this account even men with
small means prefer to have three wives instead of two, as each
wife, not knowing which of the other two she ought to hate
the most, divides her jealousy. It takes, however, a wise man
to know how to live in Polygamy, so as to balance all the conflicting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
interests and obtain a little peace, if happiness is out
of the question.</p>

<p>Where the husband is a rich man and has abundant wealth
wherewith to supply the wants of his numerous wives and
children, and to furnish all the necessary accommodation that
a growing family demands, much of the jealousy and ill-feeling
inseparable from Polygamy can, to a certain extent, be
avoided.</p>

<p>It would be quite impossible, with any regard to propriety,
to relate all the horrible results of this disgraceful system. It
has debased the minds and degraded the lives of good and
honest men and women, while those who naturally had a tendency
towards evil have become a hundred times worse. Marriages
have been contracted between the nearest relatives;
and old men tottering on the brink of the grave have been
united to little girls scarcely in their teens; while unnatural
alliances of every description, which in any other community
would be regarded with disgust and abhorrence, are here entered
into in the name of God, and under the sanction of a
“Revelation” supposed to proceed from the pure and holy
Saviour.</p>

<p>I was much shocked and disgusted when first I went to
Utah, to find a man whom under other circumstances I had
known in London, living with two sisters whom he had married
in the manner I have just described, and, strange as it
may appear, it was not with them a matter of necessity. When
I knew the husband in Europe, I considered him a man of
education and refinement; but I certainly was mistaken, for no
man whose nature was at all sensitive would have lived as he
did. His wives, too, who had been considered highly respectable
English girls, were not ashamed of their degraded position;
they professed to believe in bringing the world back to its primitive
purity and innocence.</p>

<p>It is quite a common thing in Utah for a man to marry two
and even three sisters. I was well acquainted with one man
who married his half-sister, and I know several who have
married mother and daughter. I know also another man who
married a widow with several children; and, when one of the
girls had grown into her teens, he insisted on marrying her
also, having first by some means won her affections. The
mother, however, was much opposed to this marriage, and
finally gave up her husband entirely to her daughter; and to
this very day the daughter bears children to her step-father,
living as wife in the same house with her mother!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>In another instance, a well-known man in Salt Lake City,
who has several wives and married daughters, married a young
girl of fifteen years of age whom his wife had adopted and
brought up as her own.</p>

<p>Quite a number of the leading Mormons have wives in the
various settlements; and this is very convenient to them if
they have to travel much. If the wives are old and experienced,
as wives who are sent into the country generally are,
they can then look after and manage a farm; and if they have
growing boys, the farm can be worked upon a very economical
plan. The younger wives in the city can be supplied from them
with all the butter, cheese, vegetables, &amp;c., that they require.
It takes considerable shrewdness to manage women in such a
way as to turn all their abilities to good account and to make
them profitable.</p>

<p>Let me ask the good brethren who read this to act for
once impartially, and try to put themselves in a woman’s place;
and let me for their benefit draw a little picture for them to
contemplate.</p>

<p>It is evening, and the family are all assembled in their
pleasant home—a home made happy by the kind and thoughtful
care of a loving father. Peace and tranquillity dwell in
every heart, and the father is happy in being surrounded by
his children, to whom he is fondly attached. He listens to
the prattle of the little ones, or the music and songs of the
elder children; and for a time he is forgetful of everything
save the happiness of the hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly his wife, the mother of his children, whom he
dearly loves, rises from her seat beside the fire and retires to
her own apartment. There she arranges her toilet with irreproachable
care, sees that every straying curl is in its place,
and gives every touch to her appearance which she thinks is
likely to render her attractive in the eyes of a man. She now
descends the stairs, ready to leave the home of this, her first
husband, for she is going to see her second husband, or some
young man to whom she has taken a fancy, and who she
thinks would be suitable for a third. She kisses her children
good-bye, and is about to take an affectionate farewell of their
father, when she suddenly discovers that he is not looking
happy. “What is the matter now?” she says; “is not your
home a pleasant one? have I not taken pains to train your
children in a proper manner, and have I not remained an hour
longer than usual with you? What folly it is for you to be
moping in this way! this is not the way to live our religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
if we expect to get the blessing of God. You know
very well it is very painful for me to leave you and my
children; but we must be obedient to the commands of God,
and I owe attentions to my other husband as well as to
you!”</p>

<p>Can any man be supposed who would for a moment endure
such an outrage upon decency and common sense, such a violation
of all that is sacred in the human heart? And yet this
is only reversing the case; and just as any Mormon man can
suppose he would feel, if the wife he loved were to act in the
way I have described, so do Mormon wives feel, only as much
more acutely, as women are more sensitive in their affections
than men.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF POLYGAMY—MARRIAGE AND BAPTISM
FOR THE DEAD.</span></h2>

<p>My life was now one continued series of deceptions, as was also
that of my husband, and we began habitually to wear the mask
when in each other’s presence.</p>

<p>It may have been wrong, perhaps, but I confess that for
my husband’s intended bride I felt such a detestation that I
could not endure her presence, although I knew that she was
not to blame. I believed that I should not have felt it so much
if she had been a little older; but to have a mere child placed
on a level with me, and to be compelled to treat her with all
the respect due to a wife, was so terribly humiliating to me that
at times I thought that I could not endure it another day. She,
of course, expected to be treated with all the consideration
which is proper to a wife, and to be consulted in everything by
my husband, as a wife should be. She was not, however, competent
to undertake any household duties or wifely cares, and
was herself an additional responsibility to me. Young and inexperienced
as she was, she had everything to learn; but, at
the same time, she stood so much upon her dignity that it was
anything but a pleasant task to teach her. It of course devolved
upon me to instruct her in everything, and I found it anything
but a congenial task. I soon began to look upon her simply as
a boarder, and expected nothing more from her than I should
if she had really been such.</p>

<p>She took very kindly to this position, and would spend her
days in her own room, reading and otherwise amusing herself,
and of course was always pleasant and well-dressed to receive
her husband. But this did not suit <em>me</em>. In fact I do not know
what would have suited me at that time, for I was disposed to
be displeased with everything. And yet a visitor to our house
would, I have no doubt, have, said, “How very pleasantly those
two wives get along together!” This has been said of scores of
women in Utah by casual observers—Gentiles, who thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
they “understood” the system. How little do they know the
aching void and the bitter hatred which exists in the hearts of
those wives—the detestation which they have of one another!
How little can they know, when everything is so carefully
hidden, even from their husbands! It is a shameful thing that
women, faithful wives and mothers, should be placed in such
a position.</p>

<p>How many times during the day have I been compelled to
leave everything and rush to my chamber, and there on my
bended knees supplicate for strength to endure, thinking all
the time that, in ordaining this Revelation, God had given us a
burden greater than we could bear!</p>

<p>Then in the evening, when we were assembled together in
our cosy parlour, as we were wont to be, all traces that remained
of the terrible struggle which I had endured were a
sad countenance and perhaps the deepening lines upon my brow,
which contrasted unpleasantly with the bright and cheerful
face of the young wife, and made my husband feel that I was
getting very sour in my disposition, as indeed was probably
the case.</p>

<p>Things and actions, which at another time I should have
considered too trifling to notice, had now a painful significance
to me. On one occasion, not long after the wedding, my husband
asked me to take a walk with him, and I consented.
Among the Mormons it is a custom to take their wives out
together very frequently. Their object, I presume, is to display
the “jewels” in their crowns before the eyes of their less
fortunate brethren. I had resolved that I would never submit
to this; if my husband would not take me out alone, I
would stay at home. On the occasion I mention, when I came
out of my room ready dressed, I found him and his wife,
Belinda, waiting and chatting pleasantly together, and looking
unutterable love at each other—at least, so I thought—and I
felt greatly insulted and annoyed, and told them I did not wish
to go. I carefully avoided showing any outbursts of temper
before the young lady, which I thought would be undignified,
for I desired at least that she should respect me, though I did
not want her love. If I had expected that they would urge
me to accompany them, I should have been greatly mistaken,
for my refusal appeared to be just what they wanted. They
tripped off together as light-hearted and happy as children,
while I remained rooted to the spot, tearing my pocket-handkerchief
to pieces, and wishing I could do the same with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>I used sometimes to wonder whether it would be the same
in the Mormon heaven, where this Celestial Order of Marriage
is expected to be carried out in all its fullness, and I felt
troubled for myself. These dreadful feelings would, I believed,
be the ruin of my soul, and I thought it was impossible for
me to obtain salvation until I had entirely subdued them—and
that I had not power yet to do. I had, however, so concealed
what I felt, that my husband believed that I was becoming
used to this new life.</p>

<p>Day after day my rebellious soul was agitated by the same
troubled feelings. There was no rest for me—nothing upon
which I could stay my mind. My husband was painfully
aware that there was a coldness and restraint existing between
his young wife and myself, and I know that he was grieved by
it, for he had tried in every way to create a friendly feeling
between us. I felt, however, that it was utterly impossible
that I could ever be affectionate towards his other wife, much
as I might strive. I would do my duty, but I could not love
her, or, in fact, him either for that matter, when he was associated
with her. I regret to be obliged to confess such a
truth; but from that time, and as long as I remained in Mormonism,
the sentiment that was uppermost in my mind was an
utter detestation of the whole system. I despised myself for
being the abject slave that I was. Why could I not have the
moral courage to set everything at defiance—Revelation and
all—and free myself from the bondage that enthralled me?</p>

<p>I know this day scores of women in Utah who think and
feel exactly as I did then, who suffer wrongs against which
their hearts daily and hourly rebel, but who, like me, dread to
cast aside the yoke of the oppressor.</p>

<p>At that time, in respect to pecuniary matters, we were very
comfortably off. Almost immediately after our arrival in
Utah, Mr. Stenhouse had found employment on the staff of
the <cite>Deseret News</cite>. Before long he obtained the appointment
of postmaster for Salt Lake City, and before his marriage with
Miss Pratt he had started the <cite>Telegraph</cite>, the first daily paper
that was ever published in Utah. From the beginning it had
been remarkably successful; for Brigham had counselled the
people to sustain it, knowing very well that he himself would
in return be supported by my husband. Brigham had no more
devoted follower than Mr. Stenhouse was then, for the scales
had not yet fallen from his eyes, and he believed the Prophet
was really what he claimed to be—a faithful servant of God.
True, we had frequently talked together of his very mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
actions; but my too generous, or perhaps too credulous,
husband had attributed all that to the weakness of his human
nature, and would not believe that it affected his priesthood.
He therefore sustained him strongly and consistently before
the public; not for gain, for he had given too many instances
of his devotion to be suspected of that; but I may say from
pure attachment, for I know too well that at that time he was
almost ready to lay down his life for the sake of his religion.</p>

<p>The <cite>Telegraph</cite> soon became the leading journal in Utah,
and in a little while we were surrounded by every comfort and
luxury which at that time could be procured in Salt Lake City.
No family in the Territory was better provided for than was
ours, not excepting Brigham Young’s. I had always believed
that if my husband were left alone, untrammelled by the
Church, to make his own way, he would do so successfully. In
this I was not mistaken. We now owned a fine dwelling-house,
a valuable city lot and house, where the paper was
printed, and also another very desirable lot, near to Brigham
Young’s residence. This last lot was my own; it was very
beautifully situated, and we expended on it upwards of three
thousand dollars. Everything that my husband undertook at
that time seemed to prosper—not excepting his love affairs.</p>

<p>Just then a great deal was whispered privately about certain
murders which had been committed, all knowledge of which
was strenuously denied by the authorities. When any case
was so notorious that it could not possibly be altogether hushed
up, we were told that the murdered persons were dangerous
people, and had been killed in self-defence by those whom
they in the first instance had attacked.</p>

<p>My husband, like hundreds of others, was never in the confidence
of the Church authorities in these matters. He believed
firmly in the divine mission of Joseph Smith, and shut his
eyes to the actions of Brigham Young, thinking that he alone
would be responsible to the Lord for his misdeeds. When I
drew his attention to the inconsistency of Brigham’s conduct,
as on more than one occasion I did, he said we had enough to
do to look at home and see that we ourselves did what was
right. This, of course, was true; but I thought, nevertheless,
that a little more consistency on Brigham’s part would not be
amiss.</p>

<p>My talkative friend called one day to speak of a very serious
subject.</p>

<p>“I have come, Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “to talk to you
about a matter of great importance, but I don’t want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
offend you, and you must promise beforehand to forgive
me.”</p>

<p>I readily promised, and she added: “I thought I should find
you very unhappy, Sister Stenhouse, about poor dear Carrie
Grant, and I think if you are so you deserve it, but I don’t like
you to be miserable, and so I came to comfort you.”</p>

<p>“But, Sister Ann,” I said, “I don’t want to be comforted
in the way you seem to mean. I have been very sad indeed
at losing Carrie; but you know I did everything I could
for her, poor girl, and I have nothing to blame myself for.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to blame yourself for?” she exclaimed. “Why,
Sister Stenhouse, you have everything to blame yourself for.
If poor Carrie has less glory, it is all your fault.”</p>

<p>“How so?” I said.</p>

<p>“Why,” she answered, “if you had not held back and expressed
your dislike, Carrie would have married your husband,
and would most likely have been alive now. She would have
had <em>her</em> family, and would have added to your husband’s glory;
while now, although she is your husband’s wife, she has no
children, and, of course, must have less glory in the Kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sister Ann,” I said, “I never thought of it in that
light. I loved Carrie very much, and I tried to make her love
me. It was not until almost the last that I knew of her love
for my husband; but if I had known before, I am sure my
own heart would have rebelled against my husband taking
another wife. I did, however, ask him to marry her, and
after she was dead I was married to him for her.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well, Sister Stenhouse,” she replied, “but
for all that I think you have committed a great wrong against
that poor orphan girl. You ought to be thankful that at last
you were able to repair a little of the mischief which you did.
I don’t want to vex you, but I am really sorry that you had
such an antipathy to your husband having Carrie. However,
I suppose, now he has really got another wife, you are not so
much set against Polygamy. You must find it quite a blessing
to have Miss Pratt—I beg pardon, I mean Mrs. Stenhouse
number two—with you now.”</p>

<p>I did not answer her, for I had my own opinion about the
matter. She went on without hesitation: “Well, you must
not be vexed with me, dear; I say it all for your good, you
know; but I do wish you felt a little more as I do about these
matters. Why, do you know, I have been trying to show
my faith and zeal in every possible way ever since we came to
Utah. It was only last week I was baptized for Queen Anne.”</p>

<p>“Queen Anne!” I exclaimed. “What can you possibly
mean?”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I say, Sister Stenhouse; I was baptized for
Queen Anne, and if you like I’ll tell you all about it. It is
only just what every one else has been doing, only they were
baptized for other people. I don’t think you’ve ever thought
much of this, and so I’ll explain myself. You see, Sister
Stenhouse, the Elders teach us that the whole world is lying
in darkness and sin, and has been so ever since the apostolic
gifts were lost ages ago. Now there is no salvation outside
the Church, and you may remember that Christ Himself went
and preached to the miserable souls in Paradise.”</p>

<p>“In Paradise?” I said, “why I thought that was a happy
place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “not very happy. The
souls of those who have not heard the gospel, and have not
been baptized, go there, and it’s a sort of prison for them until
they are brought out again through the kindness of some
believer. The thief on the cross went there, and Christ went
there and preached to the spirits in prison; and when the
Elders die, they go on mission to Paradise and preach to them
also. All your people and my people, our fathers, and mothers,
and grandfathers, and so on, right up to the apostolic times,
are waiting in Paradise with millions and millions of souls to
be released and be admitted into the Celestial Kingdom. All
the good brethren and sisters have been doing their best to
get out their relations and friends, and I know many of them
who have sent over to England and have spent large sums of
money in tracing their pedigrees and genealogies, in order to
find out the right names and to be baptized as proxies for the
dead who owned those names. I have been baptized for a
good many of my own relations, and I mean to be baptized for
scores more; and many of the brethren, too, have been married
as proxies for their own friends, and for distinguished people
besides, so that they might be admitted into the Celestial Kingdom,
and raise up patriarchal families of their own. The poor
souls, if they were released from Paradise by a proxy baptism,
could not, of course, have been married in heaven, as there
is no giving in marriage there; so some one was married for
them as proxy to some one else, and now they can begin to establish
their own celestial kingdoms.”</p>

<p>“And have you been proxy in this way, Sister Ann?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No, and yes,” she replied; “I haven’t yet been proxy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
marriage for any one, but I was proxy in baptism. When we
were children, I remember we used to have some rhymes about
Queen Anne, and, as it was my own name, I always thought a
great deal of her. It seemed to me that it would be very nice,
and at the same time very charitable, if I were to help her out
of Paradise. It quite struck my fancy, for it was no small
thing to have a real queen thankful to you for so much. So I
went and was baptized for her, and now she is out of Paradise
and has entered the Celestial Kingdom. But that isn’t all.
There was my old friend, George Wilford, who heard all about
the matter, for I see him frequently, and he at once said that
he would be baptized for Prince George of Denmark, Queen
Anne’s husband, and he means to do so; and after that we’ll be
married by proxy for them here on earth, and then they’ll both
be happy.”</p>

<p>“Why, Sister Ann, what a droll idea!” I said.</p>

<p>“Sister Stenhouse,” she replied, quite seriously, “it’s very
wrong of you to talk so. Some of the best Saints have stood
proxy in this way. There was one lady who stood proxy for
the Empress Josephine, and her son stood for Napoleon, and
some one else for Washington. Queen Elizabeth, too, has
been baptized by proxy. And now Napoleon and Washington
are both Mormon Elders, and I suppose some one will be
married for Queen Elizabeth, and she’ll enter into Polygamy.
Do you know, Sister Stenhouse, there was one brother who,
out of pure kindness, said he would be baptized for the thief
on the cross, for he supposed that no one else would take pity
on him, and a sister who was present said she would be baptized
for his wife, if Brother Brigham thought he ever had one.
I’ve been persuading my Henry to be baptized for Henry the
Eighth, for I’m sure he needed baptism for the remission of
sins; and he—I mean <em>my</em> Henry—has promised me to do so;
but he says that he means to ask Brother Brigham first before
he is married for him—if ever he is—as King Henry was
almost a polygamist in his way, and my husband thinks there
is not much need to be married for him at all.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help being amused,” I said. “Of course I have
often heard of being baptized for the dead, and I know the
Elders say that St. Paul spoke of it in one of his epistles, but
I never thought of it in <em>that</em> light; I always thought we should
have to wait till the Temple was finished.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, Sister Stenhouse,” she replied; “all the
marriages of all the Saints—of every one, in fact, on the face
of the earth—ought to be solemnized in the Temple here in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Salt Lake City, and every one ought to receive their Endowments
in it; but as it is not yet finished, the Lord permits us
to be married, and everything else, in the Endowment House.
But you know yourself that there’s a record kept, and that,
when the Temple is finished, the ceremony will be all gone
through with again. I’ve heard it said that many of the Elders
and their wives will live there, and that day and night perpetually
the ceremonies will be going on. You ought to be baptized,
however, <em>now</em> for as many relations as you can think of.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall wait, Sister Ann,” I said, “until I can find
a Queen Fanny, and then I’ll be baptized for her.”</p>

<p>She did not like me saying this, for she evidently thought I
was jesting. I was not jesting, however, but I felt greatly
amused, for this peculiar doctrine of the Saints had never
struck me in such an odd light before. Sister Ann was
shocked at the way in which I viewed her strange stories, but
“I’ll come again in the course of a day or two, Sister Stenhouse,”
she said, “and put you all straight.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">MY DAUGHTER BECOMES THE FOURTH WIFE OF BRIGHAM
YOUNG’S SON—THE SECOND ENDOWMENTS.</span></h2>

<p>After I had consented, and in reality had given my husband
a second wife, my <em>status</em> in Mormon polygamic society was
very considerably improved. First wives who lived in, and
firmly believed, this “Order of Celestial Marriage,” tried
in every way to make me feel that I was one with them;
and those who had not much faith felt more kindly towards
me, because I had been caught in the same snare with themselves.</p>

<p>Every polygamic wife, whether first, second, third, or tenth,
no matter how much or how little she may believe in
“Celestial Marriage”—no matter how refined or how coarse
and degraded her nature may chance to be—must feel
that her position is inferior to that of a monogamic wife.
On this account, many of the Mormon women are never satisfied
until they have drawn every woman of their acquaintance
down to their own level. The influence of this supposed
“Revelation” is by no means elevating or refining.</p>

<p>I was now upon an equal footing with other first wives.
They had, therefore, no hesitation in confiding to me their
griefs; and, situated as I was, I had abundant opportunities of
hearing stories of cruelty, wrong, and suffering, under the
“Celestial” system—many of them so utterly revolting that
I would not dream of relating them again. Polygamy among
the Mormons is so full of disgusting and disgraceful details,
that a modest woman would not dare to relate all she knew.
In this book I have endeavoured to be true to my title and to
“<em>tell all</em>,” as far as such a thing is possible. But there are
thousands of horrible incidents, which form part and parcel
of the system of Polygamy, but which no woman who
had any respect for herself would think of putting upon
paper.</p>

<p>Previous to the time when my husband took his second wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
although I had learned too much, I had to a certain extent been
kept in the dark respecting some of the vile and loathsome
practices of Polygamy; but after that, by slow degrees, I was
thoroughly initiated into the system.</p>

<p>Visitors to Utah would perhaps notice in the faces of the
Mormon wives a dull, careworn, weary expression, altogether
the reverse of that contented look which is seen among
“Gentile” women. But those very women would never disclose
to the stranger the depth of that sorrow which is wearing
away their lives. Some few, indeed, have been led to speak
of their troubles; but they have afterwards found that the
very persons in whom they confided most distorted and exaggerated
every word that they had uttered, for the sake of
making a good story for the press. In many cases the names
of those who were thoughtless enough to expose their sorrows,
together with little personal matters which should never have
been made public, were put into print; and when the matter
came before the Church authorities, as in course of time it
was certain to do, there was a great deal of trouble and
unpleasantness. Women, consequently, as a rule, tell nothing;
and book-makers and people connected with the press, while
they give to the world astonishing stories of what they have
heard, know really nothing of the truth. When a smart man,
or a man connected with the press, comes to Utah, the Church
authorities take him in hand at once. He is carried here and
there, and treated with the utmost deference; a pair of Mormon
spectacles is placed by Brigham, or one of his numerous
factotums, upon the visitor’s eyes, and through them he looks
at all that transpires. Then comes a glowing account in the
papers, or else apocryphal stories appear in the visitor’s last
new book; and unsophisticated people, who innocently suppose
that all that is in print must be true, begin to think that
the stories of the evil-doing of the Prophet, which from time
to time have crept out, were only scandalous reports, and that
Brigham Young—like somebody else who shall be nameless!—was,
after all, not quite so black as he has been
painted.</p>

<p>A gentleman, who had for five years resided in Salt Lake
City, said to me a few months ago: “Mrs. Stenhouse, when I
had been here about three weeks, I thought that I knew enough
of Mormonism to write a book; when I had been here three
months, I began to think that I did not know quite as much;
and now, after five years, I have come to the conclusion that I
really know nothing at all. I have lived in a Mormon family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
for the past year, but that has not increased my knowledge.
They are constantly upon their guard. They treat me kindly,
but they never let me know anything.”</p>

<p>This, I believe, has been the experience of nearly all the
Gentiles resident in Salt Lake City. Gentlemen had no chance
of learning anything, and the opportunities of ladies were only
a trifle better.</p>

<p>Up to this time I had said very little to my children about
my doubts and fears. With the exception of my daughter
Clara, they were all too young. Clara was just budding into
womanhood, and day by day gave promise of more beauty and
interest in her future life. I dreaded to cast a cloud across
her way by telling her of my own apprehensions in respect
to Polygamy. If that were the “Order” of “Heaven,” she
would certainly have to live in it; and in any case it was the
“order” of Brigham Young, and my child could not escape
from it.</p>

<p>We had lived together in Polygamy about a year, when my
husband told me that his young wife desired to have a home
of her own, and that he intended to provide her with one.
This was very pleasant intelligence to me; for the sight of that
other wife constantly before my eyes, sitting at my table, in the
midst of my family, walking in the garden with my husband in
the evening, or <i lang="fr">tête-á-tête</i> with him in the parlour, was more
than I could bear. I began to feel, whether justly or not, that
my presence was a restraint to them, and that they felt
annoyed when I was with them. This feeling was so
strong with me that I constantly avoided them, and I finally
concluded to spend the evenings in my own room with my
children, for, being out of their presence, I should perhaps be at
peace.</p>

<p>This, however, was all changed when my husband established
a second home. I did not mind being deprived of his society
so long as I could get rid of <em>her</em>: her presence was painful to
me, and when she was near me I hardly felt able to breathe.</p>

<p>Just at that time the marriage of my daughter Clara first
began to be talked about seriously. One day my husband being
out driving with Joseph A. Young, the eldest son of the Prophet,
the subject was discussed between them, and Joseph A. made
a proposition of marriage. This, to me, was the cause of considerable
uneasiness, as Joseph A. was a Polygamist, and at first
I altogether refused to listen to the suggestion. At that time
Clara was not fifteen years of age, and not only did I consider her
altogether too young to think of marriage, but I was shocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
at the bare idea of her becoming a polygamic wife. I almost
hated Joseph for asking for her.</p>

<p>Personally I had no objection to Clara’s lover. I had known
him for several years. He was an intelligent, generous-hearted,
and handsome man, of very good standing among the Saints,
and wealthy. As a friend, I valued and esteemed him; but
that he, a polygamist, should wish to marry my darling daughter,
was very repugnant to my feelings. Clara was then growing
old enough to understand my more serious thoughts and sentiments,
and her companionship was very precious to me. The
thought of her marrying into Polygamy was to my mind
almost as painful as the thought of her death would have
been.</p>

<p>My husband agreed with me that she was too young to
marry; but on that point <em>he</em> could not offer any great objection,
as his own wife, although very womanly in appearance, was but
very little older in years. I told Joseph A. of my reluctance to
the proposed marriage, and he fully entered into my feelings.
I could not absolutely refuse him, but I wished to gain time.
Every day found me more and more weak in the faith, and I
thought that, if I could only postpone my Clara’s marriage for
a few years, something might transpire which would relieve me
of my difficulty.</p>

<p>Joseph promised to wait just as long as we thought proper,
if only we would allow him to speak to Clara and explain to
her the sentiments with which he regarded her. In this he
acted in a way very unlike the Mormon men generally, and I
respected him accordingly. I promised him that I would not
influence my daughter, but would let her decide for herself.
This, after much careful consideration, I came to the conclusion
was all that I could do. My mind at that time was in a
very troubled state. Day by day my doubts respecting the
plural wife system became stronger and stronger, and I felt
that before very long some great change <em>must</em> take place, both
in my fate and in my life. At the same time, outward circumstances
gave no promise of any such change. My husband
gave no signs of apostasy, and, as a Saint, I knew he would
never think of undertaking anything without the permission of
Brother Brigham. We did not even dare to leave the city
without consulting the Prophet. In times, then very recent,
it was at the risk, and sometimes, indeed, at the sacrifice of life,
that any one left Salt Lake Valley without permission; and even
at the present moment no good Saint who values his standing
in the Church would dream of going East without first obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the approval of Brigham Young. I could not, therefore,
at the time of which I write, foresee the great changes which
have since taken place. To refuse my daughter to the Prophet’s
son would, I knew, be utterly useless. By partial submission
I might gain some advantages; and the longer I postponed
the marriage, the greater chance there was that “something”
might turn up, which we all more or less look for when
we are placed in circumstances which admit of the exercise of
very little choice or effort.</p>

<p>My only objection against Joseph A. was, as I just stated,
that he was a polygamist; but so long as we remained in the
Church I could not openly allege this in opposition to the
proposed marriage. If my Clara married a single man, there
was every chance, if not an absolute certainty, that after a
while he would take another wife, or wives. This had been
the case with other girls with whom my child was acquainted.
They had married single men, trusting that their influence over
them would be sufficient to retain their affections ever to themselves
alone; but they had soon reason to see how groundless
their expectations and hopes had been. If, on the other hand,
I gave my daughter to a polygamist, there was certainly no
reason why Joseph A. should be refused. I felt surrounded on
every side by difficulties, and out of them all I endeavoured to
choose the least.</p>

<p>One day my husband told me that Brigham Young had
seriously spoken to him about the matter, and had “counselled”
him to let the marriage take place at once, saying that my
Clara was quite old enough. After this, objection on my part
would have been utterly unavailing. Everything was settled
at the <i lang="la">fiat</i> of Brigham; and the feelings and judgment of a
father and mother in respect of their own daughter were, of
course, of not the slightest consequence.</p>

<p>The wedding-day was therefore fixed, when the sweet flower
of my own quiet garden was to be transplanted to another
home.</p>

<p>We went to the Endowment House—my husband, myself,
and our daughter, together with some friends of the family.
There we met with Joseph A. Young, the expectant bridegroom;
his father, Brigham Young; Joseph A.’s first wife,
Mary Young; and several of the brethren. The bride and
bridegroom, and the bridegroom’s first wife, were all dressed
in their Temple robes. We then entered a small room where
the altar, of which I have already spoken, is placed. At the
end of the altar, Brigham was seated in a large armchair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
covered with crimson velvet. The altar was also crimson.
Brigham officiated. Joseph A.’s first wife, Mary Young, knelt
in front of the long crimson altar; and my daughter Clara
knelt beside her on a sort of faldstool or ledge, arranged for
that purpose. Behind the altar knelt Joseph A. Brigham
said: “Joseph, are you willing to take Clara Stenhouse to be
your lawful and wedded wife for time and for all eternity?”
Joseph answered, “Yes.” Then Joseph’s first wife was told
to place the right hand of my daughter in the right hand of
her husband, in token that she was willing; and then Clara
was questioned, as Joseph had been. When she replied in the
affirmative, Brigham said, “I pronounce you man and wife in
the name of the Lord. Amen.” They were now married;
and Brigham Young, Joseph A.’s first wife, and a few other
friends, came home to the wedding breakfast, after which my
daughter went to her own pleasant home.</p>

<p>Thus my worst fears were realized. My own daughter had
become a polygamic wife; she was the fourth wife of her
husband, Joseph A. Young.</p>

<p>It is a source of sorrow to any mother who really loves her
children to lose them, even if it be for their own good and
happiness; but in my own case there were reasons why I felt
the loss of my daughter more than I should have done under
ordinary circumstances. I felt quite desolate without her; for
when left all alone, when my husband took his second wife,
and when I had no one else to turn to, my little daughter had
entwined herself about my heart in a thousand sweet and
loving ways. She knew how great an influence music had
over me, and how much I loved to hear her play and sing;
and when she saw how sad my heart was, or caught me in
tears, she would go to her piano, and lure me to her side by
some sweet song which she knew was dear to my memory.
But with her went all that love and gentleness which in my
time of deepest trouble sustained me and kept me from absolute
despair.</p>

<p>I have often wondered whether Joseph ever realized how
great, how dear a gift, I bestowed upon him when I gave him
my little Clara. But in saying this I do not mean to cast the
shadow of a doubt upon his true-heartedness and love towards
her. He was always kind and thoughtful, considering her
comfort in everything; and although they have now been
married seven years, he has never changed, but is the same to
her as on the first day of their marriage. A good, kind, and
gentle husband he has ever been, anticipating her every wish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
tenderly and carefully guarding her from even a painful thought.
My only regret has been that he is a polygamist, and she a
polygamic wife.</p>

<p>Not long after this, my husband one day told me that a select
few had been chosen to receive their Second Endowments, and
that we were to be honoured with the same privilege. This I
was told was one of the highest honours that could be conferred
upon us, as the Second Endowments had never been given to
any one since the Mormons left Nauvoo.</p>

<p>The glory of this privilege I did not myself, however, feel;
and, notwithstanding any respect which might be intended by
our names being added to the list of chosen ones, I refused to
see the slightest good in the whole affair. I am afraid I was
naturally perverse—or was it that the light was now beginning
to dawn more clearly upon my mind? I know not. But
I raised every possible objection, feeling, though I did, that all
opposition on my part was useless. I knew that I should have
to go, but I felt a dismal satisfaction in letting every one know
how much I hated the system.</p>

<p>“Our” second wife—I say “<em>our</em>,” because I had been taught
that my husband and myself were indissolubly one, even in
the matter of taking wives—“our” second wife seemed the
happiest of us all when the day arrived, and I believe she
considered that we were very highly favoured. After preparing
our Temple robes, we started for the Endowment House.
The reluctance which I felt caused me to lag behind, and I
was <em>gently</em> reminded several times that I was making myself
very disagreeable. I did not, however, feel much remorse, for
my husband had still one good, obedient wife walking at his
side, who I knew would sympathize with him; and that, as
every one is aware, is more than falls to the lot of every
man.</p>

<p>When we reached the Endowment House, we ladies were
shown into one room and <em>our</em> husband into another. We then
proceeded to array ourselves in our robes, caps, and aprons—the
same as when we received our first Endowments—and
when all was ready we were ushered into another room by one
of the brethren, who was also dressed in his Temple robes.
There we met <em>our</em> husband and several other brethren, all
dressed in the same way. We sat down, and oil was then
poured upon the head of <em>our</em> husband by two of the brethren—Daniel
H. Wells and another—and he was then ordained a
King and Priest to all eternity. After that, we two wives
were anointed in like manner, and ordained Queens and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Priestesses, to reign and rule with <em>our</em> husband over his kingdom
in the celestial world.</p>

<p>Had I ever solaced myself with the notion, which some
Mormon women entertain, that first wives are queens over all
the rest, I should have been sadly disappointed when I heard
“<em>our</em>” second wife ordained to the same high office as myself.
As it was, however, my faith was so small that I should have
been quite contented had they consecrated her alone queen for
Eternity, so long as they would have allowed me to rule and
reign by myself in my own home for Time.</p>

<p>The ceremony did not last long; but it all appeared to me
such folly that I was anxious to leave the place, and, though
I dared not say so, I was truly ashamed to be seen coming
out of the House. While going through these Endowments
I was filled with a thorough contempt for everybody and
everything around me, and I suppose that my feelings were
visible upon my countenance; for, after leaving the House, I
remember the Apostle John Taylor asking me if I did not feel
well, and I told him as plainly as I dared what really was the
matter. He spoke to me very kindly, and tried to reassure
me; but the scales were now falling from my eyes, and all his
arguments availed nothing.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, I was not ready yet to cast off the
yoke, and a few months after our Second Endowments I again
gave evidence of my faith. An event occurred in the other
branch of my husband’s family which produced a strong impression
upon my mind—a little daughter was presented to
him by his second wife. I was, of course, expected to go and
visit the young mother and child, and I thought I could never
bring my mind to do that.</p>

<p>It would be impossible for me to define my feelings at that
time—loathing and hatred for him and for her, and even for
the poor innocent babe, on the one side; and, on the other,
thoughts of what I considered was my duty towards God, my
husband, and his other lawful wife. I was bewildered. My
heart said, Do not go; but my conscience said, It is your duty
to treat her kindly, for she believes she has done you no
wrong. Then I thought, She is a young mother, and, without
you frowning upon her, sorrow will come swiftly enough
to her door.</p>

<p>I saw that my husband was troubled as to what my feelings
might be, although he had not had courage to tell me himself
of the interesting event. He was afraid of paining me, and
sent a lady friend with the intelligence. I spoke to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
myself, and told him that I would go and see Belinda and her
child. He thanked me, and said, “God bless you for that.”
Then I went to see her; but I was thankful when the visit
was over; and although I went again many times, and tried my
very best to treat her kindly and even affectionately, I could
never get over the painful feelings which agitated my mind
when in her presence.</p>

<span class="smaller">REALITIES OF POLYGAMIC LIFE—ORSON PRATT: THE STORY
OF HIS YOUNG ENGLISH WIFE.</span></h2>

<p>The position of the plural wives—second, third, fourth, or
twentieth, it matters not—is but a mockery, after all; and in
many respects they are more to be pitied than the first wives.
The first wives have known, if only for a little while, a husband’s
love and care; but that has never been felt by the
second wives. They are, in fact, in many respects little
better than slaves; and if they are sensitive girls, their position
must be extremely painful, for they must realize at all
times that they are receiving the attentions of another
woman’s husband; and in many instances they are even
afraid to be seen speaking to their husband for fear of bringing
down the wrath of the first wife upon their heads.
Others, who are not so sensitive, assert their own rights and
are defiant.</p>

<p>I am well acquainted with a pretty young Welsh girl who
was a second wife. Her husband had converted her to Mormonism
while he was on a mission to Europe, and when they
reached Salt Lake he married her. I saw her first two years
after her marriage, when one day she came to me in the greatest
distress. She asked me if I would give her some employment,
and, greatly surprised at the request, I asked her how
she came to need anything to do, as I knew her husband could
well afford to support her.</p>

<p>“I have left my husband,” she answered, “for I could stand
no longer the ill-treatment that I received. I endured it
until, as you see, my health is failing and I am broken-hearted.
The creature I married has no manhood in him. He has
allowed me to be treated like a slave, and has himself half-starved
me, and has acted towards me with the greatest inhumanity.
When I married him,” she said, “I was willing to
make myself useful in the family, and I did so. But one thing
after another was given me to do, until I became a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
drudge; they would not have dared to treat a hired girl in the
way they treated me. I was put into a miserable little back
room, and was never allowed to see any of my friends; I had
to work early and late. When at last my position would not
admit of my working quite so much, they punished me with
all sorts of petty unkindnesses, and nearly starved me, giving
me only a little flour or a few potatoes every day.</p>

<p>“At last,” she continued, “I went to Brother Brigham to
know what I should do. He sent for my husband and talked
to him a long time, and he promised to do better if I would
go back with him. Brother Brigham counselled me to do
so, and try him again; and I went. Soon after that, my
babe was born, and then they treated me with worse unkindness.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean by <em>they</em>?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I mean my husband and his wife,” she replied. “They
did not seem to look upon me as a wife at all, and even in the
coldest mornings, and immediately after my child was born,
they used to make me get up first and light fires and prepare
breakfast and begin work generally, and I was only too
glad if I escaped with a little fault-finding. I stood it as
long as I could, because Brother Brigham had counselled
me to do so; but now I have left them again, and do not
mean to return.” This was the story of one poor girl’s
troubles.</p>

<p>Now the man, Elder Jos. Bull, who did this is a good Mormon,
in good standing in the Church to-day. He is employed
by the authorities, and his poor young wife is now working
for the Gentiles—a much happier woman, if her face speaks
truly, since her separation, although she has to support herself
and child. She, like hundreds of other young girls, came to
Utah without friend or relative, and this is how a good brother
“took care” of her.</p>

<p>But I must be permitted to relate a still more painful story—the
story of a poor innocent girl allured from her happy
home in England by one of the most distinguished of the
Mormon Apostles; brought over by him to Utah as his wife,
and there suffered to die in misery and neglect.</p>

<p>The Apostle Orson Pratt, who is called among the Saints
“The Champion of Polygamy”—a man who has devoted his
life to Mormonism, and whose writings have done more than
the labours of all the other Apostles to win converts to Polygamy;
a man who on more than one occasion has boldly stood
up against many of the absurdities and blasphemies of Brigham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Young; a man upon whom, on account of his independence,
Brigham has frowned, and who has consequently never
attained to the wealth of his more obsequious brethren; a
man who in all the ordinary affairs of life would command the
respect of every one around him. This was the man who perpetrated
the atrocious villainy which I am about to relate;
and much against my own personal inclinations I feel compelled
to tell the story, as it shows how shockingly this
debasing system can pervert an otherwise upright mind.</p>

<p>Orson Pratt married the young girl of whom I speak in
Liverpool, by special dispensation from Brigham Young; and
her parents—themselves devout Mormons—thought that
their daughter was highly honoured in becoming the wife of
an Apostle. She was very pretty and attractive, and for a time
he paid great attention to her, and brought her over to Utah
as his bride. Arrived there, he utterly neglected her, and she
experienced all the horrors of polygamic life.</p>

<p>The Apostle was living in Salt Lake City. He had left his
young wife and her children in Tooele—a place about forty
miles distant. There they lived in a wretched little log-cabin,
the young mother supporting her little ones as best she could.
When her last child was born, she was suffering all the
miseries of poverty, dependent entirely upon the charity of
her neighbours. At the time when most she needed the gentle
sympathy of her husband’s love, that husband never came to
see her.</p>

<p>One morning there was literally nothing in the house for
herself and her children, who, knowing nothing of their
mother’s sufferings, cried to her for bread.</p>

<p>The poor mother quieted them with a promise that they
should soon have something to eat, and then she went and
begged a few potatoes from a neighbour; and upon these they
subsisted for three days. She then took her children with
her, for they were too young to be left alone—her babe was
only three weeks old—and she went round to see if she could
get work of any kind to do. In this she was not successful;
and at length, worn out by continual anxiety and privation,
and heart-broken by the neglect which she had experienced,
she sank beneath a fever which promised very soon to prove
fatal.</p>

<p>For some time the neighbours nursed her; but they, of
course, had their own families to attend to, and could not give
her quite all their time, and thus occasionally she was left
alone. One evening, when such was the case, she got up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
state of delirium, and barefooted, and almost destitute of
clothing, took her children, and wandered forth with them
into the snow. The good people of Tooele went out over the
prairie, anxious to find and bring back the poor maniac, but
for a long time their search was in vain. At last, not knowing
whither she went, she wandered to the house of Brother
Eli B. Kelsey—a “vile apostate” as Brigham Young would
call him; but known to every one else, Saint, Apostate, or
Gentile, as one of the best and kindest-hearted men that ever
lived. In Brother Kelsey’s house she and her little ones were
kindly received by him and his good wife, and their wants
attended to. They were clothed and fed, and were then carried
back to the log-cabin which they called their home.</p>

<p>Next day the Mormon Bishop of Tooele assembled the
people, and money was collected and sent to Salt Lake City,
to Orson Pratt, begging him to come immediately, if he wished
to see his wife alive. But the Apostle did not come. At
that time he was actually engaged in taking another bride,
and he wanted to hear nothing of his dying wife.</p>

<p>Then the good Bishop sent a young man, who rode all
night, to compel him immediately to take the coach for
Tooele—the young man paying his fare, so that he might have
no excuse. Then, at last, he came.</p>

<p>Arrived at the little town where his poor wife lay dying,
Orson conducted himself like the philosopher he professes to
be. Before him stood the hovel, within which were his
deserted little ones—wailing, as if sensible of the great loss
of a mother’s care which they would soon have to sustain—and
there, on her dying bed, was that poor wife and mother,
tossing in wild delirium. But he, the cause of all that woe,
passed by that wretched hovel and its death-scene to the comfortable
home of a well-to-do brother, at whose house he first
obtained his supper, and then, calmly returning, entered the
place where his wife was lying, and for a moment surveyed
the scene. Then he quietly remarked to one of the sisters
present: “She has a good deal of fever.”</p>

<p>Another sister, who stood by, impulsively exclaimed, “Good
God! Brother Pratt, this is more than fever; she is dying.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no, sister,” he calmly replied; “she will recover.”</p>

<p>It was evident, however, to all but Orson that his wife <em>was</em>
dying, and that no earthly power could save her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DESPAIR.</p>
<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 326.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The next day she was still raving, and it was told me that
in her wild frenzy she even attempted to strangle her babe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
Orson essayed to hold her, but she caught his gold chain and
snapped it in two. His touch and the sight of the chain
recalled her for a moment to her senses, and she said reproachfully,
“You are puffed up with pride, Orson, with your gold
chain and rings, while you leave me and my babes to starve.
Poor little lambs! where are they?”</p>

<p>For a moment the yearning of a mother’s heart for her
children conquered the fever that tortured her mind, and she
listened to her husband’s attempted words of comfort, as he
said, “I am with you now, Eliza, and I will take care of you.”</p>

<p>Steadily, for a moment, she looked up into his face, and, with
tears in her eyes, said mournfully: “It is <em>too late</em>, Orson—it
is <em>too late</em>!”</p>

<p>These were the last sane words which she uttered in this
life, although she still lingered on insensible.</p>

<p>The next morning the Apostle Pratt resolved to leave for
Salt Lake City and his young bride. The Bishop, however,
called a council and summoned him to remain until his wife
was dead. Nevertheless he did not wish to stay, and, being
an Apostle, he overruled the council. At the last moment
before his intended departure, one of the sisters said: “Brother
Pratt, should she die, what shall we do with her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she won’t die,” he replied.</p>

<p>“But should she?” the sister urged.</p>

<p>“Then bury her with her children,” he answered.</p>

<p>After much solicitation, he was prevailed upon to remain for
a few hours, and the next morning his wife died. The language
of her last moments, as she raved and tossed in mad
delirium, showed how terrible had been her mental agony, and
how much she had suffered from this frightful system.</p>

<p>But one might easily fill a large volume with stories quite
as cruel as this. It is simply absurd to expect that it should
be otherwise. Men and women can train and discipline their
minds, they can crush out the affections of their hearts if they
will; but no effort of man can change man’s nature entirely,
or root out altogether humanity from the soul. Women may
endure, as that poor woman did whose story I have just related,
but they never can get perfectly adapted to the system of
“Celestial Marriage.” The nearer they approach to its requirements,
the further they recede from all that is held good and
noble in womanhood; and as for the men, they are brutalized
by every effort which they make to conform to it.</p>

<p>During the summer, about three years ago, a young-looking
woman, very shabbily dressed, came frequently to my house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
with heavy baskets of fruit, which she entreated me to buy.
One day she said: “You do not remember me, Sister Stenhouse,
I think, and I do not wonder, for I am so changed. I
have to work very hard now, for all I have to live upon is
what I can make by selling fruit, or any little work that I can
get my neighbours to give me to do; and if my husband could
prevent even that, I believe he would. I am obliged to
gather my fruit at night and hide it from him, and that is why
I urged you so to buy, for I never know when I may meet
him.”</p>

<p>I was very much surprised at this, as her husband, I knew,
was getting a good salary, and appeared to be a most gentlemanly
man. His first wife, I was aware, had left him, it was
said, on account of cruelty and neglect, and he had married
this one just after her arrival from England. I had every
reason to believe that she had been a good wife to him, and a
mother to his motherless children; but he had taken another
wife since he married her, and had cruelly neglected this poor
woman, leaving her his first wife’s children to take care of.
She said that he was again paying his addresses to another
still, and she expected that he would soon marry her. And
yet this woman [his second wife] told me that all he had left
for her and the children to live on was a sack of bran and
about fifty pounds of corn meal. Everything else had been
taken to the third wife, even to the best articles of furniture.</p>

<p>She said: “One evening I had been sitting in the porch in
my rocking-chair, when he came in and remained about an
hour. As soon as he left, I went out to bring in the chair,
and was just in time to see him carrying it off. I knew where
he was going with it.” I saw this poor woman frequently, and
bought her fruit often when I did not need it, for it grieved
me to see her carrying such heavy loads in her then delicate
situation. After a time I lost sight of her, and then I heard
that she was dead. One day her own daughter—for she was
a widow when she married this man—came to me before leaving
the city. “I am going away to some friends,” she said,
“for I will never live near that man; he killed my mother;
he kicked her so severely that she never recovered, and when
her child was born, they both died from the effects of the blows
which she had received—and I hate him.”</p>

<p>The first wife of “Brig.” Hampton, one of the Mormon
authorities, told me how her husband whipped her because she
would not consent to his stripping their home of everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
that was either useful or handsome in order to furnish a house
for his second wife. Finally, he shut her up while he took
her entire parlour furniture away. She was a fragile little
woman, and perfectly helpless when in the power of a strong
man, and therefore was forced to submit, as there was no
appeal to law in Utah.</p>

<p>It is a very difficult thing for a woman, after listening, day
after day, to such tales of woe and misery, and knowing them
to be true, to retain any respect for a polygamist, whoever he
may be. For my own part I regard them all with such feelings
of loathing that I can hardly speak civilly of them, and would
prefer never to speak to them. I know scores of ladies—married
ladies—Mormon ladies, who in secret feel and speak
just as I do upon this subject.</p>

<p>For many years past the American Elders have derived a
rich harvest from Britain and Scandinavia. After the introduction
of Polygamy, an Elder was seldom known to return
from Mission without bringing with him one, two, and sometimes
three young girls, or else arranging in some way for
their emigration. The Missionaries, however, preferred, whenever
it was possible, to bring the girls with them; for if they
trusted them to the care of a brother returning before or after, he
very frequently turned traitor, and carried off the prize himself.</p>

<p>The Elders were not permitted to marry these extra wives
while on or returning from a mission, unless they had special
permission from Brigham Young. But quite a number of the
poor weak brethren were so impulsive and so anxious to be
married, that they could not wait for the ceremonies of the
Endowment House. One conscientious Swiss brother, named
Loba, who could find no one willing to take the responsibility
of marrying him while crossing the Plains, said that as he was
an Elder he could just as well marry himself, and be under no
obligation to anybody; and he did so. He had fallen in love with
a little miss—a mere child, about one quarter of his own age.</p>

<p>Many men have married wives, and have brought them
home, before their first wives knew even that they were in
love. They had not had courage to introduce the subject,
but believed that when the wife found that it was done, and
could not be undone, she would see the uselessness of feeling
badly, and would soon get over it. But no wife who
has been thus treated ever did “get over it.” What can a
man know of woman’s nature who would dare to act thus
towards her, and think that she would become reconciled to
such treatment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>What strange ideas the Mormon men must have of woman’s
nature if they believe that women can submit to such treatment
as this and still love them! What folly to think even of love!</p>

<p>It would be very wrong for me to say that there are <em>no</em>
men who try to be just in the practice of Polygamy, for I know
many who try their very best to act impartially to all their
wives; but this is not really the result of their religion, about
which some of these men appear to care very little. I feel
sure that if they are good men, notwithstanding the evil effects
of Mormonism upon them, they would have been much better
men without it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have known men who, before they
became Mormons, were reputed good husbands and fathers,
but who afterwards became cold and harsh in their natures,
cruel to their wives, and neglectful to their children. It
seemed as if they thought of nothing else but courting the
girls and taking more wives, altogether regardless as to whether
they could support them or not.</p>

<p>Some of the Elders, finding that they might not marry plural
wives before they reached Utah, have bound the girls by
solemn vows and covenants to marry them when they arrived
in Salt Lake Valley; and the poor girls, believing that,
because these men were Missionaries, all they said and did
<em>must</em> be right, have often—in fact, in almost every instance—to
their own great injury, kept their “covenants” and married
the men to whom they were vowed. I have known personally
and intimately several women who have in this way ruined
their prospects and blighted the hopes of their whole lives,
and sadder stories than theirs could not be told.</p>

<p>My husband had again left Salt Lake City, and had gone
to “the States,” as we then called “going East;” for it was
such a long journey that we felt ourselves altogether out of
the pale of civilization. I felt, therefore, comparatively free;
for I could now, whenever I desired to do so, walk out, or visit
a friend, without the constant dread of meeting him and his
wife. It always humiliated me to see them together, although
I believed that it was perfectly right that my husband should
show attentions to his other wife. It was not <em>now</em> jealousy
that I felt—the day of jealous feeling was long past. I felt
disgusted, and I was humbled at the sight of them. At one
time, for nearly six months, I remained at home, never going
further than my own garden, simply for the reason that I
feared to meet <em>her</em> in the presence of any of my friends—particularly
any of my Gentile friends; or worse still, with <em>him</em>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">“OUR” HUSBAND’S FIANCÉE—A SECOND WIFE’S SORROWS—STEPS
TOWARDS APOSTASY.</span></h2>

<p>At one time I had almost begun to think that my husband
had seen enough of the discomforts and heartlessness of polygamic
life, and that his eyes were looking back wishfully to
the time when, as the old Scotch ballad says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“One loving heart was all his own,</div>
<div class="verse">But there as king he reign’d supreme.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">My faith in my own acuteness and perception was, however,
very considerably shaken when one day he told me that he
thought it was about time for him to think of taking another
wife. I suppose he expected that I should express some
astonishment or offer objections, for he proceeded to give me
excellent reasons for what he was about to do. His greatly
improved circumstances; his desire to sustain his brethren;
and, above all, the necessity that he should “build up a kingdom!”</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying all this. The Lord had certainly
very greatly blessed him in basket and in store; it was, moreover,
praiseworthy in him to wish to sustain his brethren; and
nobody could deny that he ought to have a “kingdom!” To
crown all, the young lady whom he proposed to honour this
time could not possibly be objected to by any loyal Saint, for
she was of the seed royal of the modern Israel—a daughter of
the high-priestly house of Brigham Young!</p>

<p>I suppose, if I had been a right-minded woman, I should
have felt the great glory that there was in the proposed alliance.
But, in point of fact, such is the perversity of human nature,
I did not feel at all pleased, although I could say nothing in
objection. I had had some slight suspicion that my husband’s
eyes, to say nothing of his heart, had lately been inclined to
wander in a certain direction, for he had become so particularly
regular in his attendance at the theatre. I mentioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
matter to him once or twice, but he answered that as an
editor it was a matter of necessity for him to attend, and that
he ought to be there always. This I might, perhaps, have
believed, had it not been that it was now several years since
his paper was first established, and hitherto his personal
attendance at every representation had not been considered
absolutely indispensable. Reporters had been able to do all that
was necessary.</p>

<p>His proposal to marry this young lady, now it was openly
stated, shed light upon many things which had before appeared
to me rather obscure. Her name was Zina, and she was the
daughter of Mrs. Zina D. Huntington Jacobs, whom I have
already mentioned as one of the Prophet’s wives. She was
one of the actresses in the theatre—for many of Brigham’s
daughters at that time took part in the representations—and I
had frequently observed very pretty little notices of her in the
Salt Lake <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>.</p>

<p>I did not much care now how many wives my husband took—he
might as well have twenty, as the one too many which
he already had—his marriage to another could not possibly
make me feel any worse, provided I was not compelled to
associate with her. I had resolved that I would never live on
familiar terms with his other wives—not because I might disrespect
or dislike them personally, but because I could not
overcome the purer and better teachings of my early life.</p>

<p>My husband in due form proposed, and was accepted; and
it was soon rumoured abroad that he was going to many one
of the “President’s” daughters—Brigham is always spoken
of as “President” Young among the Saints. In the course
of a day or two they were formally “engaged,” and a more
loving couple could not possibly have been found. The young
lady herself afterwards told me that their love was of no
ordinary kind, and I’m sure I did not doubt her word. But
consider how pleasant such intelligence must have been to a
wife!</p>

<p>Zina’s friends, who wished to cheer me up and make me
happy, told me that my husband’s love for her was perfectly
engrossing; they “thought he could never have really loved
before”—“there was something very beautiful in their
loves!”</p>

<p>Zina pitied us, I know, when she realized that <em>we</em> could
never know the great depth of <em>our</em> husband’s love for her. She
spoke and acted as if this were how she felt; and I have no
doubt that she intended, after her marriage with <em>our</em> husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
to treat us with great kindness and consideration, as a sort of
recompense for what we never had truly known, and never
could know <em>now</em>—<em>our</em> husband’s love!</p>

<p>As is almost always the case when the husband takes a third
wife, a better state of feeling was brought about between my
own husband’s second wife and myself. Belinda no longer
centred all her jealousy in me. She now, to a certain extent,
began to realize what I had suffered when my husband courted
her; she felt badly, and I really did sympathize with her
when I remembered how young she was, and that she was the
mother of three little children. She had her moiety of a husband,
it is true; but, like all other polygamic wives, that was
her misfortune rather than her comfort and strength. Many a
wife would be happier were she a widow; in fact, widows are
the happiest class of women in Utah, for they realize that it is far
better to have a dead sorrow than a living one.</p>

<p>Now, our husband always maintained that he was not in
love with Miss Zina, but that in making love to her he was
acting entirely from principle. So all the brethren say, and I
have never yet heard of any one of them ever confessing—except,
of course, to the maiden herself—that he was in love.
To the maiden herself he says, not only that, but a great deal
more. But if our husband, at the time of which I speak, was
not in love, the saints forbid that I should ever see him in that
condition! I am sure when I heard his fiancée speaking of
their devotion to each other, and of the fond attachment of her
heart to him (for she felt no delicacy in speaking to me—his
wife—about such matters), I came to the conclusion that I had
never known what it was to really love, and that my nature
was too crude and unrefined to understand the mysteries of the
tender passion. There was no love in the case, <em>our</em> husband
told us—all pure duty!</p>

<p>Long courtships had become quite fashionable among the
brethren in Salt Lake City, and I dreaded a long courtship
more than anything else, for there is so much that is humiliating,
and I might even say disgusting, to a wife when her
husband is engaged in love-making to another woman, that I
hoped, as much as possible, to be spared passing through such
an ordeal a second time.</p>

<p>As the accepted lover and affianced husband of Brother
Brigham’s daughter, our husband was, of course, constantly in
attendance at the Prophet’s house. But he was not the only
good brother who spent his evenings in Brigham Young’s
parlour; for it was then—and I suppose it is to-day—a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
rendezvous for middle-aged and young men, and even boys;
and there the Prophet’s little girls, as well as those who were
grown or growing up, obtained an excellent training in the
art of flirting and courting.</p>

<p>It has always been said among the Saints that Brigham’s
girls, and the daughters of Daniel H. Wells, were the boldest
and least retiring maidens to be found in Salt Lake City, and
that they presumed greatly upon their imaginary high position;
which position nobody but themselves cared anything
about. It is well known that the very people upon whom
they look down are those who rightly should receive their
warmest gratitude and respect, on account of the more than
liberal support which they have given to their father, even to
the detriment of their own children.</p>

<p>When first I heard that my husband had set his affections
upon one of these girls, I felt convinced that he could not
have made a very wise choice; and I could not help dreading
that the mere fact of my husband having selected a daughter of
the Prophet as his future wife would bring trouble upon us all.
What shape that trouble would take I could form no conjecture,
but I felt sure that a change of some sort was fast approaching.
My faith was almost gone; I felt the degrading position in
which the “Celestial” system placed me and my children, and
it seemed to me that I could no longer endure it. My children
I could not, and would not leave, but it was impossible for me to
continue to live as I had been living; nor would I think of
bringing up my children any longer to believe and live a religion
which had so cruelly blighted my own life. It was for them
that I feared now; I felt that for their sake I must break
away from this horrible system.</p>

<p>My own life, I thought, was not worth caring for, but the
idea of my little girls growing up and following in my
footsteps and enduring as I had endured, was more than I
could bear. Something must be done to save them from such
a fate.</p>

<p>About this time I procured a copy of the “Revelation on
Celestial Marriage,” and read it through carefully and calmly,
from beginning to end. The reader may, perhaps, remember
that when a copy of it was first given to me, in Switzerland,
years before, I was so angry and indignant that when I had
got only partly through it I cast it from me in disgust as an
outrage upon all that was good and true. From that time,
although I had heard portions of it quoted and read, I had
never perused it as a whole. On two occasions, at least, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
friend Mary Burton was very near reading it through with
me, and had we done so, I have not the slightest doubt that
my eyes would have been opened to the absurdity and
wickedness of the whole system, and years of wretchedness
would have been spared me.</p>

<p>Such, however, was not the case. It was not until I had
almost drained the cup of sorrow and degradation that, at last,
I found an antidote in the deadly thing itself which had been
the source of all my unhappiness. I was acting upon the
homœopathic principle—“<i lang="la">similia similibus curantur</i>”—and
using a dose of poison to cure a disease caused by that
poison.</p>

<p>As I read, I saw plainly, <em>from the wording of the document</em>,
that if ever it was given to Joseph Smith—no matter by
whom—it was given <em>long after</em> he had <em>practised</em> Polygamy—or
something as bad—and to sanction what he had already done.
I had read in the Book of Mormon:</p>

<p>“David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines,
<em>which thing was an abomination before me, saith the Lord</em>....
Hearken to the Word of the Lord: for there shall not any
man among you have, save it be one wife; and concubines
he shall have none.” [<cite>Book of Mormon</cite>, p. 118.]</p>

<p>In the Book of the Covenants, given through Joseph Smith,
and held sacred by every Saint, I had read:</p>

<p>“Thou shalt love thy <em>wife</em> with all thy heart, and cleave
unto <em>her</em> and <em>none</em> else.” [<cite>Book of Covenants</cite>, p. 124.]</p>

<p>And yet when I turned to the “Revelation” I found in the
very first clause:</p>

<p>“Verily, thus saith the Lord unto my servant Joseph, that
inasmuch as you have enquired at my hand, to know and
understand wherein I, the Lord, <span class="smcap">justified</span> [!] my servants
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon,
my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of
their having many wives and concubines,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>What could I possibly think of a “Prophet” who, after
having the law laid down so clearly, and being told so distinctly
that the doings of David and Solomon were an “abomination,”
and that a man should have <em>but one wife</em>, should
enquire of the Lord how He “justified” the very things
which He had just declared were “an abomination” unto
Him?—Then, too, what blasphemy to represent God as one
day giving a “Revelation” declaring a thing sinful, and the
next day “justifying” it! I felt perfectly humiliated with
myself that I had never before had the courage to look the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
matter calmly in the face and discover, as I must have discovered,
had I only used my unaided reason, the shameful
imposture which had been palmed upon us. I now made
careful enquiry, and it was soon clear to me that evidence
was not wanting to prove that the doctrine of plural marriages
originated in the licentious hearts of Joseph Smith and those
associated with him. When once I was convinced of that, the
whole fabric of my religion crumbled before my eyes; and
from that time I can hardly say that I had faith in anything
that had been taught me.</p>

<p>My husband’s second wife was also very unhappy now.
She, too, after the general rule, had flattered herself that <em>she</em>
was “his first and only love,” and it was not pleasant to
have her dream of happiness dispelled; but now that another
“jewel” was to be added to <em>our</em> husband’s crown, she could
no longer deceive herself. She little knew, poor girl, when
she married, that a Mormon’s heart is like a honeycomb—there
is always a vacant cell wherein another may nestle.</p>

<p>Real trouble, too, she had. One of her children was taken
very sick, and after a very severe illness died. I remained
with her night and day, and did what I could for the poor
child. Had it been possible for me to have felt a greater
loathing and detestation for that vile system of Polygamy,
that feeling would have been conceived while I watched at the
bedside of my husband’s dying child. It was there that I
vowed that no polygamists should ever marry another daughter
of mine, and resolved that to my dying day my voice should be
raised against the unholy and unnatural teachings of the Mormon
Priesthood. I looked at that lonely young mother, who
in her hour of trial ought to have had <em>all</em> her husband’s
sympathy, <em>all</em> his attention, to support her; but who, instead,
knew that, however kind he might be to her, he was contemplating
a new marriage, and his thoughts must of necessity
be more or less with his purposed bride. All unkind feeling
was banished from my heart—I forgot that she was my husband’s
wife, and remembered only that, like myself, she was a
suffering woman, a victim to a false faith; and I felt very
deeply for her in her time of sorrow and bereavement.</p>

<p>My husband, at this time, had been a member of the Mormon
Church for twenty-five years. He had lectured, preached,
written and published, in Great Britain, Switzerland, and the
United States, in support of the Mormon faith. He had been
a most earnest and consistent member of the Church, and
devotedly attached to Brigham Young. This attachment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Brother Brigham he shared in common with all the staunchest
of his brethren; for while the members of the Church retain
unshaken confidence in the new revelation, they naturally acquire
a great regard for the Prophet, and render him unquestioning
obedience. I believe that my husband would willingly
have laid down his life, if by so doing he could have shielded
Brigham Young from harm or have been of essential service
to him.</p>

<p>But causes were now in operation which, by-and-by, detached
him from the Church, and made it possible for me also
to leave the Mormon faith. Hitherto, for my children’s sake,
I dared not leave the Church without my husband, and I
therefore anxiously watched for anything which might rescue
him from the bondage in which he was held.</p>

<p>As proprietor of a daily paper, his business had frequently
called him to the Eastern States for several months at a time,
and I observed that after those visits his editorials took a
more liberal turn. My Mormon friends frequently said to me,
“Brother Stenhouse is doing himself no good by his constant
association with the Gentiles;” and subsequently, when he
did apostatize, our secession from the Church was attributed
to contaminating Gentile influences.</p>

<p>Then, too, we had frequent visits from strangers passing
through Salt Lake City. I saw, with pleasure, that this intercourse
with the outside world was gradually undermining
my husband’s confidence in the teachings of the Elders, and it
gave me courage to hope that, after all, the day of liberty
might dawn at last. Feeling as I did thus, it will not surprise
the reader that I regarded with more and more distrust
the proposed marriage of my husband to Brother Brigham’s
daughter; for I felt that then he would be deeper than ever
in the toils of the Priesthood, and I sometimes almost believed
that it was my duty to use every influence in my power
to prevent it.</p>

<p>Putting my own feelings out of the question, it is probable
that I might have done this simply for his own good; for I
doubted not that some day the scales must fall from his eyes,
and then he would be thankful that I had prevented the marriage.
Our paths by this time had certainly diverged far
asunder, and my husband had another wife and family; but I
believed that he was sincere, though sadly mistaken, or I
should not have felt so kindly towards him as I did.</p>

<p>At other times, and observing his devotion, I almost myself
began to think that perhaps the nonsense that I had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
was, after all, true, and that this girl <em>was</em> the only one he had
really loved; and, if so, of course he ought to marry her. In
fact, so divided was my attention that I hardly knew what to
think; I therefore resolved to act according to circumstances.</p>

<p>Brigham Young, in one of his sermons, says that “the
first thing manifested in the case of apostasy was the idea
that the Prophet was liable to make a mistake: when a man
believes that, he has taken the first step towards apostasy;
he need only take one step more, and he is out of the Church.”
This was spoken of Joseph and his saints, but it suits just as
well Brigham and his; I knew very well that my husband had
taken the first step, and I sincerely hoped that he might soon
take the second. For my own part, I had for some time not
only believed that a Prophet <em>might</em> be mistaken, but, as Brother
Heber would say, I <em>knew</em> it.</p>

<p>My husband and his bride elect, like all other lovers, had
frequent little quarrels—I suppose for the purpose of making
up again, and being then all the more ardent in their affection.
But they now had a disagreement which lasted longer than all
that had gone before; although I suppose that neither of them
had, at that time, the slightest idea how it was going to end.
They had been courting for fifteen months at least, and after
so much devotion on the part of my husband, and so much
fervent affection on the part of the young lady, it really did
seem too bad that so large an amount of love should be thrown
away. It was hard that after such a long strain upon their
religious and devotional feelings—for they were both very
pious lovers—all their labour of love should come to nought.
Things had certainly taken a twist, for I knew well enough
that at one time they both firmly believed that their marriage
was pre-ordained in heaven, and that they were as completely
one in feeling as mortals ever could be. The mother, too, who
was a very pious woman, once told my husband that she had
had a vision in which it was revealed to her that they were
destined for each other in the eternal worlds:—the lovers of
course firmly believed her. But, for all that, the estrangement
still continued, and my husband was constantly making
it wider by the articles which appeared in his paper, until
at last certain of the sisters whispered that the heart of
the lady had been attracted towards some brighter luminary.</p>

<p>Long courtships often end disastrously; but when I heard
rumours of the lady’s presumed faithlessness, it seemed to me
hardly fair, for the day had been fixed for the marriage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the wedding-dress actually made. Of course I sympathized
with my husband. Would any wife like to see her husband
disappointed in his love-affairs with another woman, I
wonder?</p>

<p>While under these natural feelings of indignation, I one
day told Brigham Young that I thought, after all the courting
that had been done—and it was not a trifle—they certainly
ought to be married. He said he was willing enough
himself, if they wished it; but girls, he said, often changed
their minds, and as they could but have one husband, it was
only fair that their wishes should be consulted. “If Zina
has really changed her mind,” he added, “I have plenty of
other daughters, and they have all got to be married; let him
take one of them—if one won’t another will!” The reader
will see the liberal ideas which Brother Brigham entertains
on the subject of marriage.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, seem rather strange that I should be
anxious to have them marry; but, after all that I had seen
and endured in Polygamy, can it be wondered at that I should
no longer regard the father of my children as my own husband?
Had I thought him a bad man, or had he acted as I
know many of the good brethren do act; had he brought
home girl after girl with the hope of alluring one or more of
them into Polygamy, or had he been utterly reckless of my
feelings, I might perhaps have been able to cast him from my
heart without a single regret. But I really believed that he
was acting consistently with the teachings of his religion, and
if I felt degraded by the life I lived, it was not his fault—it
was the fault of the system. I therefore felt that if things
came to the worst, and if I were driven to extremities, and
forced to separate from him, I should like to know that he had
a wife whom he loved. I felt certain that there was now but
little love between him and his second wife, and that some
day a separation was sure to take place. The idea of divorce
was so repugnant to my feelings that it was only in moments
when grief overpowered me, and my heart was wrung with
anguish, and I felt utterly reckless, that I for one moment
thought of anything like it. Even then I only entertained the
idea of a separate life—not divorce.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">SOME CURIOUS COURTSHIPS—BRIGHAM RUINS OUR FORTUNES—BELINDA
DIVORCES “OUR” HUSBAND.</span></h2>

<p>Mormonism had been, to my husband, everything. It had
for years grown with his growth, until it had become a part
of himself. Doubts had occasionally crept into his mind, it
is true, but it required time to effect a change. The measures
adopted by Brigham Young in the spring of 1869, for the
purpose of controlling the commerce of Utah, as well as the
property and faith of the people, caused great discontent.
The teachings of the Tabernacle were wild and arrogant, and
Brigham assumed that it was his right to dictate in everything,
“even,” he said, “to the setting up of a stocking or the
ribbons which a woman should wear.” Many of the people,
when they heard these words and witnessed the fanaticism
created thereby, were aroused to opposition, but Brigham
only became more fierce in his denunciations and more harsh
in his measures.</p>

<p>I could plainly see that all this had the, to me, much
desired effect of alienating my husband from Mormonism, and
I never allowed an opportunity of strengthening the impression
thus produced to pass unimproved. The articles in his
paper showed the condition of his mind, and brought down
upon him the wrath of Brigham. At this also I rejoiced, and
did not fail to make him feel that he ought to resent the
Prophet’s interference. Brigham felt too certain of the submission
of his slave, and accused Mr. Stenhouse of having
published favourable notices of Gentile stores, also of having
their advertisements in his paper, and otherwise aiding and
abetting the wicked Gentiles—all which accusations my husband
began to feel was an infringement upon his own private
personal rights as a citizen and a man. One circumstance
followed another, and I could plainly see that his confidence
in Brigham’s inspiration was slowly but surely dwindling
away, and that the day which I had so long anxiously watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
for was breaking at last. Notwithstanding this, however,
there was one bond which still united him by no weak tie to
the Church—he was a Polygamist. The contemplated marriage
between him and Brigham’s daughter could, I believed,
never now take place; but, even allowing that, he still had
another wife; and now that I had entirely lost faith in Mormonism
generally, and the “Celestial Order of Marriage” in
particular, I resolved that I would no longer have a partner
in my husband’s affections—as if he were a “joint-stock concern!”—I
would have the whole of my husband, or none. I
had not yet, however, sufficient courage to speak to him of my
feelings.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, Mr. Stenhouse, when he came home,
said to me: “Brother Brigham has given me a mission; he
wishes me to go to Ogden and publish my paper there.”</p>

<p>I can imagine I see some strong-minded woman smile at the
idea of a wife wanting courage to speak to her husband. But
such women do not know what Mormonism is.</p>

<p>This was very unexpected news; but with the vividness of
lightning, a glimpse of what the Prophet intended by such
a strange proposition flashed across my mind. “He wishes
to ruin us!” I exclaimed; “you surely will not go!”</p>

<p>Now Brigham, of course, knew that my husband’s paper
had a large circulation in Utah Territory as well as in Salt
Lake City, and that his business was in a most prosperous
condition; he knew also that to do aught that might impair
or destroy that business would be to bring misery and disaster
upon all who were dependent upon it for their daily bread.
And yet, for all that, he told my husband to break up his
establishment, or in his own words, “to pull up root and
branch,” and go to a place where the people were so miserably
poor that it was impossible to make a newspaper successful
among them.</p>

<p>In all this the crafty Prophet no doubt acted wisely. The
<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> would in all probability become a power in
the Territory, and he feared that in a short time it would
emancipate itself from his control.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that, long before this time, he had noted
that my husband was weakening in the faith; but he had
waited for his opportunity, and now he considered that it had
come. We knew very well that this was the way in which
he had always acted towards those whom he feared or doubted;
when he saw them growing weak in the faith he ruined
them, or did the best he could to that effect, before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
finally left the Church. I urged my husband to resist this
arbitrary decree on the part of the Prophet, and represented
strongly the misery which would result from his failure, and
the utter impossibility of success. But I soon found that,
though he doubted Brigham, his faith in Mormonism was by
no means all gone—he, like many another, feared that in
disobeying Brigham, perhaps, after all, he might be resisting
God. He could see the wrong-doing of the Prophet, and felt
that his conduct was unworthy of one who pretended to such
great things; but be regarded this as the weakness of the
Prophet’s humanity, at the same time believing that in
matters of religion he might be divinely inspired. He was
still so under the influence of the past that he could not yet break
asunder the yoke and bid defiance to Brigham and the Priesthood.
He told me that now was the time for him to prove
his obedience, cost what it might; and all the brethren urged
him to submit, saying that the Lord would overrule everything
for his good.</p>

<p>Believing this, he broke up his establishment at Salt Lake
City, and went, as “counselled,” to Ogden. There he remained
for several months, during which time he was losing
money every day. Finding at last that he could stand it no
longer, he asked Brigham Young’s permission to return and
recommence his paper in Salt Lake City, for no one then
dared stir a foot without permission. This was granted, for
Brigham had now accomplished his purpose. But some of
our friends told me that the teachers, when making their
weekly visits, were telling the people not to take in Brother
Stenhouse’s paper again, if he came back to Salt Lake City,
for he was apostatizing, and they must not sustain an
Apostate. Now, I thought, my husband will believe that I
was right in my judgment of Brigham’s motives.</p>

<p>My own family and that of the second wife did not accompany
my husband to Ogden; he was therefore quite at home
when he returned, but the expense of transferring his business
from one place to another was perfectly ruinous. He had
not only purchased valuable property, as I before mentioned,
in the City, but he had also realized quite a comfortable little
fortune by the success of his paper; but now the property
had to be mortgaged, and his fortune was, of course, utterly
insufficient for these heavy daily losses. Just then, the severe
illness of my eldest son, in San Francisco, made it necessary
that we should leave immediately to attend him, for we had
received intelligence that he was not at all likely to recover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
As it was my own son who was sick, my husband had very
naturally determined that I should accompany him; but this
brought on such a severe fit of jealousy on the part of his
young wife, who already was by no means too happy, that
when we returned, after my son’s recovery, she threatened to
obtain a divorce. My husband told me of this, but I had so
frequently heard such threats from wives who were unhappy
or neglected that I thought little about it.</p>

<p>One day, not long after our return, I was quite surprised to
see Mr. Stenhouse and Joseph A. Young drive up to the
door, looking as if something of great importance had just
transpired. Mr. Stenhouse jumped out of his buggy and
hurriedly gave me a letter, as I thought—at the same time
saying, “Take great care of this, for it makes me a free man
again.” Saying this, he left the house, jumped into the buggy
again, and was gone, while I stood holding the paper, wondering
what it all could mean.</p>

<p>My husband had told me to “take care” of the paper. He
neither said “read it” or “don’t read it,” and, of course, I was
not in the least curious. The envelope was not sealed, so I
made up my mind that, though he had not said so, he must
have wished me to read what was inside, and at any rate I resolved
to risk doing so. To my astonishment I found that the
document which he said set him free was nothing else than
a bill of divorce between him and his young wife. It appeared
afterwards that she had been to Brother Brigham, had told
him of her grievances, and had asked for a divorce.</p>

<p>Now when the wife of any man who is of good standing in
the Church, and whom Brigham wishes to honour, comes to
him for a divorce, he generally sends for the husband <em>first</em>,
tells him about it, and they talk it over together. The husband
is counselled to “make the matter up,” and a compromise
is effected. In the case of my husband, Brigham
acted otherwise. The clerk had been directed to make out the
papers, which the second wife signed, and, as far as she was
concerned, her marriage was dissolved. My husband was then
notified that he was wanted at the Prophet’s office, and he had
a very shrewd guess as to what the nature of the business
was for which his presence was desired. He waited till the
afternoon, when he knew that Brigham would be absent, and
then as he was driving out with Joseph A., the Prophet’s son,
he drew up before the office and asked Joseph to accompany
him inside in order to witness a little business which he had
to transact. Joseph agreed; but when he found what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
business really was, he strongly urged my husband not to
sign the papers, or, at least, to take time and consult with
President Young first. Mr. Stenhouse, however, never for a
moment doubted that Brigham had expected by this hasty
move to bring him to his feet, and he would not therefore yield.
So, asking the clerk for the papers, he signed them, and Joseph
also signed them as a witness; the other witness was David
Mackenzie, Brigham’s clerk. Belinda had already affixed her
name. Ten dollars were then handed over as the usual fee.
My husband took one copy of the “bill of divorce,” the wife
had a right to a second copy, and the third was deposited in
the archives of Zion. My husband had then, as we have seen,
hastened home to tell me that he was “a free man:” and yet
these two had been “sealed” to each other at the altar in the
Endowment House “<em>for all eternity!</em>”</p>

<p>This is the way that divorces are granted in Utah. There
is not the slightest difficulty about them, if only Brother Brigham
is willing. The reader would, perhaps, be interested in
seeing one of these terrible documents. I therefore append a
true, perfect, and exact copy of my husband’s own bill of
divorce. It is a <i lang="la">fac-simile</i>—type, signatures, and all. This is
a specimen of an orthodox divorce among the <i lang="fr">bon ton</i> in Salt
Lake City. Out in the Settlements they do things in a much
more primitive style, and some of their documents are rather
amusing. The following is a correct copy of a Mormon
divorce bill taken from the records of Beaver City:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">March 8th 1871</p>

<p class="noindent">To whomsoever it may concern</p>

<p>This is to certify in the beginning of 1869 when I gave a
bill of divorce to Sarah Ann Lowry I gave to her for the
good of her four children the following property viz. A parcel
of land of about nine acres enclosed all around with a
house of two rooms and one cow and heifer</p>

<p class="caption-r"><i>To face p. 344.</i></p>

<p>I cannot say that I was much grieved at the sight of my
husband’s divorce. At the same time, long training in the
school of trouble had hardened my heart and rendered me
almost indifferent, and I cannot say that I very greatly rejoiced.
Nature adapts us morally, as well as physically, to the
positions which we have to occupy in life. The hand of him
who labours much becomes hard, the unshodden foot grows
horny, and the heart which at first is tender and, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Æolian harp, ready to answer to the slightest passing breath,
by and by, beneath the rough hand of trial and the world, becomes
callous and stony, and the roughest storms and the
sweetest pleasures alike seem to make little impression upon
it.</p>

<p>Thus it was with me when I received that paper. A few
years before, a reliable assurance that my husband would never
enter into Polygamy would have been to me the realization of
my best earthly wishes. But now my heart was almost dead,
and I felt as if I hardly cared one way or the other. If I felt
thus, who had still all my darling children around me, who
had never missed one dear little face from the fireside or from
the table, what must have been endured by those mothers
who not only gave away their husbands to other wives, but
who lost child after child, until, bereft of all they loved on
earth, they could but, like Rachael, sit down in ashes and
mourn for the dead?</p>

<p>But the more I thought over what had happened, the more
doubtful I felt as to what the result would be. That there
would be some great change in our life, I felt assured; but to
me the change was coming almost too late. Then, too, the
young wife who in her hasty anger had obtained the divorce.
I felt that her happiness must surely be gone, and I could not
bear the thought that my peace should be purchased with the
sorrows of another. Brother Brigham’s part in the matter
was also ever present in my mind. That he had resolved to
bring ruin upon my husband I did not now for a moment
doubt. But if a weak woman’s efforts could in any way assist
in thwarting his designs, I fully resolved that he never should
have the satisfaction of seeing those designs successful. I
would stand by my husband, I would work for and assist him,
and would give not even a passing thought to what I might
have suffered, or remember that he had ever loved others
better than myself. I would be to him now the true wife that
before God I had vowed to be, for worse as well as for better;
and however I myself might have been wronged, I would, for
my part, endeavour faithfully to perform my whole duty to my
husband and to God.</p>

<p>After I had formed this mental resolution, and had begun
to realize our new position, I felt as if awakening from a long
dream of many years. I was released from the clutches of
that frightful nightmare—Polygamy; and I could once more
take my place beside my husband as his wife. I knew that
he would have much to contend against, and would need all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the moral support that I could accord to him. Brigham’s
efforts in respect to my husband’s paper had been far too successful,
and although it was still carried on, fresh difficulties
sprang up every day. My husband had been deceived by Brigham’s
oily manner and plausible way; but to others his intention
in sending him away was no secret. A man named Bull,
who is now and was also at that time employed in the <cite>Deseret
News</cite> office, said that no one but Mr. Stenhouse had ever been
deceived by what the Prophet had done; it was commonly reported
that Brigham intended to ruin my husband, and that
when he prophesied that the paper in Ogden should be a great
success, he was himself perfectly aware that it was utterly impossible
that such could be the case.</p>

<p>Whether Brigham was the deceiver or the deceived, I do
not wish to say. Men who consider themselves inspired, and
go on day by day uttering all sorts of nonsense and blasphemy,
and giving impertinent and mischievous advice in the “name
of the Lord,” at last become thoroughly impervious to reason,
and daily and hourly deceive themselves. I hope, for his own
sake, it was so with Brigham, for I would rather believe him
a self-made fool than a downright knave; and in many of his
transactions—perhaps I ought almost to say <em>all</em>—it is clear to
every one that he is either one or the other. Of one thing I
am certain—I was fully contented that we should lose all, if
only my husband were taken, once and for ever, clean out of
the meshes of Mormonism. We might have to make a terrible
sacrifice, but to me it was a sacrifice well worth the making.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">MARY BURTON—LIFE’S JOURNEY ENDED: REST AT LAST.</span></h2>

<p>It was about this time that one morning, very early, before
I was well up, a young girl came to the house in a great
hurry, asking to speak to me without a moment’s delay.</p>

<p>I threw a wrapper round me, and went out at once to see
her. She said she came from the house of Sister Mary
Burton, and begged me to come directly and see her, for
Mary had taken poison, and it was thought she was dying.</p>

<p>Now, I have been so much engaged of late in telling my
own sorrows, that Mary Burton has quite dropped out of my
story. But it must not be supposed that all that time I saw
nothing of my poor friend. On the contrary, I had seen her
much more frequently of late than I used to when I first came
to Salt Lake City. When I last spoke of her it was when she
was about to return to Southern Utah, where she and her husband
then resided. It was evident to me from her conversation,
as it must have been to the reader, that her faith in Mormonism
had even then entirely gone; that she felt her husband’s
neglect and unkindness most keenly, and that she had become a
miserable, broken-hearted woman. It was very painful to contrast
what she now was with what she had been when I first
knew her, and then to think what a happy wife and mother
she might have been if the spectre of Mormonism had not
crossed her path.</p>

<p>Mary and her husband, Elder Shrewsbury, left the Settlements
about a year after the time I last mentioned her, and
took up their abode in Salt Lake City. Elder Shrewsbury
had prospered exceedingly, and when he came to Salt Lake he
brought with him, besides Mary, his second wife, Ellen, who,
as we before noticed, had become very much attached to her.
The other three wives and their children were left at the farm
in Southern Utah. He would probably have brought them all
with him, had there been in the city a house large enough to
hold them all. As it was, he purchased a good lot about half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
a mile from where we resided, with a comfortable house upon
it; and there his first and second wives lived together. This
was the man who had solemnly sworn before God, that <em>he</em>
would <em>never</em> practise Polygamy! But I doubt if Elder
Shrewsbury, with his comfortable house in the city, his farm
and lands in the South, his fast increasing property, and his
many wives, felt truly the hundredth part of the happiness
which he would have experienced in the devotion of <em>one</em> faithful
heart, even had it been in the midst of poverty and care. He,
however, poor infatuated man, did not think thus; he was actually
even now courting a young girl of about seventeen years
of age, who the two wives daily expected would be brought
home to aid in building up their husband’s “Kingdom.” I do
not think Mary cared much about this. It was the taking of
the first plural wife that was her great sorrow. After that, her
love for her husband weakened, until it altogether died out, and
she did not care how many wives he took.</p>

<p>Mary’s high spirit was always urging her into rebellion. In
married life both husband and wife give way to each other in
a thousand little things, of no consequence in themselves, but
quite sufficient, without the presence of love, to sow the seeds
of discord. But when love has fled, and the husband looks
upon his wife—the companion of his youth, the mother of his
children—not as the partner of his whole life and the sharer of
all his joys and sorrows, but as a person whose presence is a
reproach to him and who is an inconvenience rather than
otherwise; and when the wife regards her husband as one
whom formerly she loved with true devotion, but who has
cruelly broken her heart and trampled upon her feelings, and
who is nothing to her now but a tyrant whose very presence
is painful to her, can there then be any forbearance, any of
those gentle kindnesses, any of those loving forgivenesses,
any of those mutual tendernesses and sweet confidences which
constitute the charm of married life?</p>

<p>In giving up Mormonism, my unhappy friend gave up, as
too many have done, faith in all else. She had lived, as she
thought, a life of religion; and when she found what a terrible
mockery of all that is holy that so-called religion was, she cast
it aside, thinking that all religion was vain. She did not see
that she would have acted just as wisely in rejecting all food
because she chanced to partake of some that was poisoned;
she did not see that, although the broken reed on which she
rested was unable to yield her any true support, nevertheless
the everlasting foundations of eternal truth which God Himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
has laid can <em>never</em> be removed; and that though creeds
and systems may fail and pass away, only to give place to others
equally unsatisfactory, yet those divine verities are established
for ever, are beyond the reach of earthly vicissitudes, and know
nothing of time or change.</p>

<p>Utterly miserable and sick at heart, Mary cared not
whether she lived or died. There was nothing to bind her to
life, and beyond the life of this world she was altogether without
hope. A more wretched existence it is scarcely possible
to imagine.</p>

<p>While they were still in the Settlements, she treated the
other wives with the greatest contempt, sitting by them at the
table or passing them in the house without vouchsafing a look
or a word. Her husband, as might be expected, avoided her
whenever it was possible, and the other wives returned her
coldness and disdain, and in turn annoyed her as much as they
could when they were not too busy looking after one another.
It would be impossible to picture a house more divided against
itself than was that of Elder Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>When the two wives, Ellen and Mary, lived together with
their husband in Salt Lake City, Mary of course had no
opportunity of showing her hatred and contempt for the polygamic
wives. But towards her husband she evinced a cold
disdain, as if he were now nothing at all to her—as if her very
heart itself had been withered. For Ellen, who, since Elder
Shrewsbury had taken his other wives, had clung to her with
a child-like affection, and to her own little girl alone, she
showed that deep and constant love which she had once
lavished upon such an unworthy object.</p>

<p>She used to come to me and tell me all her griefs; and in
a passion of rage and tears she would hurl defiance at Mormonism
and curse bitterly the system that had wrecked her
life. Then I would soothe her, and speak calmly to her, and
try to place matters in their best light; and she would sit and
listen in a painful state of apathy, as if she cared for none of
these things. Presently she would rise and go, and then, perhaps,
I would not see her for weeks together, unless I chanced
to call upon her at her own house. Sometimes, for days and
even weeks at a time, she would shut herself up in her room
and refuse to see her husband or any one else, except her
little girl, who slept in the same room with her, and who at
such times used to bring in what food they wanted; for in
these melancholy fits she would not even let the servants come
near her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a little table near the window, and from the casement
of the window could be seen in the far distance the lofty
ranges of the Wahsatch Mountains. And sitting at that table,
gazing from that window, with her cheek resting upon her
hand, Mary would watch the whole day long, as if entranced in
some ecstatic vision. Her little girl—a child of winning ways,
bashful to an extreme and very pretty, but, though so young,
with a look of wistful sadness upon her childish face—had become
accustomed to her mother’s ways; and when one of
these long spells of melancholy came upon her, she would
either steal out quietly and wander away for a long walk all
by herself—for she never played with the other children in her
father’s house—or else, as was more frequently the case, she
would sit down on the ground near her mother and silently
amuse herself with a book or some childish toy.</p>

<p>To my mind there was something inexpressibly painful in
all this. When Mary did not come to see me, I would call
round at her husband’s house, and try to draw her out from
her melancholy seclusion. It was very seldom that I saw Elder
Shrewsbury, and I cannot say that I wished to do so. He
had, as his wife told me, undergone a complete change since I
knew him in England. The open look, the upright bearing,
the earnestness of speech, which then characterized him, were
now gone for ever. He was still a handsome man, rather
portly, and evidently well to do in the world; but there were
lines about his eyes which ought not to have been seen in the
face of a man of his years; and his lips, without uttering a
word, told their own story.</p>

<p>Heartbroken and wretched, weary of life, and yet with no
hopeful assurance of life beyond the grave, poor Mary lived on
year after year, while those who seemed to dance in the very
sunshine of existence were cut off like the summer flowers in
the harvest-field. Lately, however, I thought I saw symptoms
of a change. I noticed that she was perceptibly growing
thinner and thinner; her eye seemed brighter, and there was
always a flush upon her cheek, which would have been beautiful
had it not been for the seal of melancholy which was stamped
upon every feature. But the brightness of the eye, and the
flush upon the cheek, were not symbols of health, but the imprint
of the finger of death.</p>

<p>She did not know this. Though she longed to die, she
little thought that death was so near her. Sometimes she
would talk almost happily of the old by-gone days; then she
would sit brooding over her griefs; and then again she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
would talk anxiously about the future of her little daughter.
I had seen other wives as wretched as poor Mary was—ay,
more so, for they had abject, grinding poverty superadded to
all their woes; but, more than for any other I felt for my poor
friend, and exerted myself to the uttermost to comfort her. In
this I had been to a certain extent successful. She would
appear for a time a little more cheerful, but it was not long
before she relapsed into her habitual melancholy way.</p>

<p>That which troubled me most of late, in my intercourse
with Mary, was the fact that she was always talking about
<em>death</em>. This certainly was no matter of surprise to me, but
it was very painful. Over and over again she would discuss
the question whether, under <em>any</em> circumstances, suicide
could be justified, and whether if any one, in absolute
despair, were to take away their own life, God would ever
pardon them.</p>

<p>I would never enter into such subjects as these, for I considered
that such conversation showed a morbid condition of
mind, and could not possibly be of any good to either of us, and
would only suggest harmful thoughts. But again and again
Mary reverted to the subject, and I really at last began to
grow quite anxious about her.</p>

<p>It was not, therefore, with surprise that I received the
summons that morning. I did not wait to ask any questions
about the poisoning, but hastened to the bedside of my unfortunate
friend, trusting that I might yet be in time to render
some assistance.</p>

<p>I found her lying on the bed, partly dressed, and, as it
seemed to me at first, asleep. There was, at the bedside, and
bending over her, the second wife, who was in as much
trouble as if the sufferer had been her own sister. The poor
girl had been weeping, and was evidently very much distressed.
There was also present in the room another sister,
whom I recognized as a friend of Mary’s. The little daughter
of the unfortunate woman was there as well. One person,
whom every one would naturally have expected to see at the
bedside of a dying wife under such circumstances, was conspicuous
by his absence—I mean, of course, Elder Shrewsbury
himself.</p>

<p>I sat down on the bed, beside poor Mary, and took her hand
in mine. It was cold but damp, and her breathing was somewhat
heavy. She was still unconscious. I asked the pretty
pale-faced girl—the second wife—who was bending over her,
how it had all happened, and whether they had had a doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said, sobbing all the time; “we sent for the
doctor, and he has only just gone. He said he had done all
he could, and that we could let her sleep on now.”</p>

<p>She then told me what had taken place. It appeared that
the night before Elder Shrewsbury had gone up into Mary’s
room to speak to her about some matter of importance.
Although living in the same house, she had not seen him for
several weeks, and the mere fact of being in his presence
agitated her. He told her he had come to talk about her child—little
Mary, called Mary after her mother. For some reason
or other, which nobody then seemed to understand, Elder
Shrewsbury had taken a fancy that the child should be
separated from her mother; he wanted to send her to stay
with his other family in the Settlements, and it was for this
purpose he came to see Mary that night. It certainly did
seem the refinement of cruelty to separate the child from her
poor mother, who would thus have become, as one might say,
doubly widowed; and I am strongly inclined to question
whether Elder Shrewsbury’s motives were of the purest kind.
It is, however, only just to state that subsequently, when
speaking to a friend about the matter, he said that he had
long noticed in his wife what he considered were incipient
symptoms of madness, and he thought that his duty towards
the child imperatively demanded that he should immediately
take her away from her mother. He added—as was indeed
true—that his other wives in the South would have taken the
greatest care of her.</p>

<p>Mary was furious when the proposal was made to her. She
bitterly upbraided her husband for all his cruelty and neglect;
she cursed him for his perfidy, and she avowed that nothing
but death should separate her from her little girl.</p>

<p>Elder Shrewsbury trembled at the anger of his poor forsaken
wife, and he crept out of her room and downstairs.
But Mary could not be appeased. She went to the room of
the second wife—the only creature in the house, besides her
little girl, with whom she sometimes condescended to hold
intercourse—and there she acted in a very wild and extravagant
way. It was with great difficulty that she was at last
persuaded to lie down and take a little rest. She would not
go to her own room; so Ellen—the second wife—persuaded
her to remain with her all the night. She lay down, but did
not sleep. She muttered strange things, and by-and-by sat up
in the bed and spoke as if people were present whom she had
known years and years ago. Ellen was frightened; but out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of love to Mary, and not wishing that others should see her in
that crazy condition, she did not call for help, thinking that
presently she would fall asleep, and in the morning all would
be right. But the long night passed away, and just before
daybreak Ellen fell into a sort of fitful slumber. It would
seem that just then poor Mary discovered for the first time
that she was not sleeping in her own room, and that her little
daughter was not with her. Distracted as her mind was, she
probably thought that they had stolen the child away, and
went in search of her.</p>

<p>She found her way to her own room, and then what happened
no one, of course, could tell. She must have seen that
her child was safe; and it is not unlikely that, reassured on
that point, she felt that she needed rest, and thought that it
would be best to take some sedative to produce the sleep
which she believed would restore her to herself again. She
had in her room a little leather medicine-chest—a very useful
article for any one travelling, or to keep in the house—and to
that she must have had resort. Certain it is, that when, an
hour later, Ellen awoke and went to see what had become of
her husband’s first wife, she found the little medicine-chest
open upon the bureau, Mary lying upon the bed, apparently
asleep, and a faint sickly smell, which one better versed in
such things would have known was the smell of opium, pervading
the whole room.</p>

<p>Ellen began to scream and call for help, and one of the
women about the house, who was up at that early hour, came
to see what was the matter. She, upon hearing what Ellen
said, rushed downstairs shrieking for assistance. Fortunately
for every one, Elder Shrewsbury, who had just risen, was
standing in the hall-way below. He took hold of the noisy
woman and asked her what was the matter; and after hearing
all she had to say he sent her to attend to her domestic duties,
with a strict injunction to say nothing to a living soul about
what she had seen or heard.</p>

<p>Elder Shrewsbury then went up to Mary’s room, and there
he learned that all that the silly woman had just said to him
was quite true. He, however, betrayed no emotion. Very
calmly he put the stopper back into the laudanum bottle, then
looked at his watch and hesitated, all the while that pale-faced
Ellen was looking anxiously at him, wanting to know
what she could <em>do</em>. After a few moments of indecision, Elder
Shrewsbury turned to Ellen and said, “Yes; go for the
doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Ellen flew upon her mission.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Elder Shrewsbury looked towards the bed where
poor Mary lay—Mary, for whose love he had perjured his soul—Mary
who never would have been his had he not given that
sacred promise, the breaking of which made him an outlaw
from heaven and a thing to be despised of men. He looked
for one single moment at his poor wife as she lay there, and
then he turned upon his heel and went out of the room. For
the wealth of all the world I would not feel as that man felt,
if the thoughts which then crowded upon his brain were what,
for the sake of our common humanity, I trust they were.
The remembrance of the life which his folly or fanaticism—it
matters little which—had blasted; the thought of that solemn
vow which he had taken to love her only and for ever; the
sight of that dear one to whom he had once plighted his troth,
now desolate, forsaken, almost maniac in her wretchedness.
Oh God! what a curse was <em>there</em> for any man’s soul to bear!</p>

<p>The physician, when he came, administered an emetic and
made them walk the patient about the room. Ellen and
the friend of Mary who was present volunteered for this
service. They supported her, one on each side, and paced
her round and round the room, thus compelling her to exertion;
and from time to time they made her swallow doses of
strong coffee, in which a little brandy had been mixed. When,
at length, signs of returning consciousness were apparent, the
physician left, promising to call again in the course of the
morning.</p>

<p>It was then that some one present thought of sending for
me, and I arrived not long after the physician had gone. I
was the only person, outside the family, beside the friend
whom I have mentioned, who knew of anything that had
taken place—so careful were they that the matter should not
get abroad; and I should certainly not have been summoned
had it not been for the close intimacy which existed between
Mary and myself, which made us more like sisters than friends.
The reader must not, however, suppose that in relating this I
am even now betraying a trust; for my friends in Utah know
as well as I do that so many unhappy wives have in their
desperation been driven to attempt self-destruction, that having
no clue in the name, which solely out of love for my poor
friend, I have all through this narrative given her, they will
not know who to fix upon as the person to whom I allude.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
There is, however, <em>one</em> still living—<em>he</em> will know—let his own
conscience be his accuser.</p>

<p>In about half an hour’s time, Mary began to recognize those
who were around her, but she did not seem disposed to speak.
She opened her eyes and looked dreamily at me for a long
time, but the slight pressure of my hand was her only recognition
of my presence. I bent down over her and whispered
a few assuring words in her ear, and for a moment a faint,
weary smile lighted up her thin, pale face. It was not like
the sweet smiles of the by-gone days which used to suffuse her
whole countenance with sunshine—it was but the very ghost of
a smile. Presently she sank into a gentle slumber; but I
still sat by her on the bed, holding her hand in mine, and I
remained there for two or three hours. Then, after seeing
that everything was at hand which she could possibly want if
she awoke, and assured by Ellen that she would not leave her
until she was able to sit up, I left for my own home.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs, in the hall-way, I was confronted
by Elder Shrewsbury himself. This surprised me, as
hitherto he had most sedulously avoided coming in contact with
me. He gave me one searching glance, as if to read my
thoughts, and then said: “Sister Stenhouse, this is a most
unhappy affair, but say nothing about it—no good can come of
talking of such matters.”</p>

<p>I assured him that for Mary’s sake—not for his—I would
not speak of what had transpired; but when he held out his
hand for me to shake, I affected not to see it, but wished him
good-morning, and left the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For some time she said nothing to me about the sad event
which had so greatly troubled us, and when at length she
hesitatingly alluded to it, I was much relieved to find that the
taking of the deadly drug was on her part wholly accidental.
It was as I from the first suspected—for I knew and loved my
dear friend too well to wrong her even by a thought. Cruelly
as she had suffered, wretched and miserable as she was, bitterly
as she felt, the instincts of her heart were too true and
her nature too noble to allow of her seeking oblivion from her
troubles in voluntary and premeditated death, as I have known
was the case with many wretched Mormon wives. She had
only thought to take an opiate to soothe the feverish excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
which had almost bereft her of reason, and, in the weak
and enfeebled condition in which she was, the draught had
been too powerful for her. Guiltless as she was, she dreaded
that others might impute wrong motives to her in what she
had done; and even to me she spoke of her sickness painfully
and with hesitation.</p>

<p>After this, I called day after day upon my poor friend, until
she was sufficiently recovered to walk about and even to get
out of doors a little. The story of the unhappy attempt which
she was supposed to have made upon her life, by some means,
however, got rumoured abroad, and she heard of it. She said
nothing at the time, but I believe it preyed upon her mind.
Weak and failing in health, as she long had been, the shock
which her system had received was too much for her, and it
was evident to every one who saw her that her earthly trials
would soon be ended. She sank gradually, and life ebbed from
her gently and without pain. A few days before she died, she
sent for me, and I spent several hours with her. I might say
that they were happy hours; for the near prospect of death
seemed to have dispelled all those gloomy fears of the future
life which had for so many years troubled her soul; and she
now looked forward with peaceful resignation to her approaching
change. Death came at last to her when she was sleeping,
and she passed away tranquilly and without a sigh. I almost
rejoiced when I heard that at last her weary journey was over,
and she was at rest. I loved her with the fondest affection,
and shall never think of her without bitter feelings towards
that unholy system which brought her to an untimely grave.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">MY HUSBAND DISFELLOWSHIPPED—WE APOSTATIZE—BRUTAL
OUTRAGE UPON MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF.</span></h2>

<p>Notwithstanding all my own personal troubles and the difficulties
which surrounded us, the loss of my dear friend affected
me very deeply. And yet her story is the same as might be
told of hundreds of other English girls who have been lured
from their happy homes and have died broken-hearted and
neglected in Utah.</p>

<p>Now came that change in our life which I had so long
hoped for, but which had always seemed to me so very far
distant. We had been tossed by many a storm, but the violence
of this last gale was such that it forced us clean out of
the sea of Mormonism, and landed us high and dry upon the
firm ground of Apostasy.</p>

<p>About the time when my husband returned with his paper
to Salt Lake City, the <cite>Utah Magazine</cite>, a liberal journal just
struggling into existence, began to call in question some of
Brigham’s measures; and the editors, who were all men of some
mark in the Mormon Church, presumed to hint that the people
had rights and privileges as well as the Priesthood. This was
done in a very quiet, unobtrusive way; but it was, nevertheless,
pronounced rebellion and apostasy. My husband’s paper was
silent upon the subject; and, in consequence, he was suspected
of being in league with the enemy. This was another good
reason why the people should be “counselled” not to take
the <cite>Telegraph</cite>. Although he was not yet sufficiently advanced
in thought to give much direct aid to the questioners of
Brigham’s authority, I saw with pleasure that he did not wish
to oppose them; the tone of his paper was evidently changing,
and the articles which appeared from time to time gave serious
offence to Brigham Young. This, however, was not all his
wrong-doing; he had of late been neglectful in his attendance
at the “School of the Prophets”—a meeting which was then
held every Saturday for the benefit of the Elders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>Together with the editors of the <cite>Utah Magazine</cite>, Mr.
Stenhouse and one or two others were summoned to appear at
the School, to give their reasons for previous non-attendance.
This they had all along anticipated, and were therefore not
surprised at the summons, but they hardly expected that
Brigham would act so precipitately; for, without waiting to
hear their reasons, he disfellowshipped them all for irregular
attendance.</p>

<p>Brigham’s assumption of the right to disfellowship men from
the Church because of irregular attendance at the School was
a stretch of authority which startled my husband: “What will
he not do next?” he said. “To submit would be to acknowledge
him absolute, and myself a slave. There is but one alternative
now—slavery or freedom. Cost me what it may, I <em>will</em>
be free!”</p>

<p>In August of the same year my husband sent a respectful
and kindly letter to the Bishop of our ward, stating that he
had no faith in Brigham’s claim to an “Infallible Priesthood,”
and that he considered that he ought to be cut off from the
Church. I added a postscript, stating that I wished to share
my husband’s fate—little thinking that within three days my
request would be answered in a too literal manner.</p>

<p>A little after ten o’clock on the Saturday night succeeding
our withdrawal from the Church, we were returning home
together. The night was very dark, and as our residence was
in the suburbs of the City, north of the Temple block, and the
road very quiet, the walk was a very lonely one and perhaps
not altogether too safe. We had gone about a third of the
way, when we suddenly saw four men come out from under
some trees at a little distance from us. In the gloom of the
night we could only see them very indistinctly, and could not
distinguish who they were. They separated; and two of them
came forward and stumbled up against us, and two passed on
beside us. For a moment I thought that they were intoxicated,
but it was soon clear that they were acting from design. As
soon as they approached, they seized hold of my husband’s
arms, one on each side, and held him firmly, thus rendering
him almost powerless. They were all masked, for it was supposed
that thus we should not be able to discover their identity,
and that if by any chance an investigation should subsequently
be made into the doings of that night it would not be possible
for any one to witness against them.</p>

<p>The movements of the two men who held my husband were
somewhat impeded by my clinging to his arm, and they seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to hesitate for a moment. The other two, who stood a few
feet distant from us, also hesitated. One of the men who
held my husband said to them, “Brethren, do your duty.” We
recognized his voice at once as that of a policeman, Philips, a
young man whom we had known in Southampton, England,
when a child.</p>

<p>In an instant I saw them raise their arms, as if taking aim,
and for one brief second I thought that our end had now surely
come, and that we, like so many obnoxious persons before us,
were about to be murdered for the great sin of Apostasy. This,
I firmly believe, would have been my husband’s fate, if I had
not chanced to be with him, or had I run away—they would
probably have beaten him to death—they were two of the
regular and two of the special policemen—and then, the next
morning, they would have “discovered” the body, and it
would have been said that he had been murdered by the
Gentiles or Apostates in a personal quarrel. My presence
somewhat disarranged their plans, and it was that probably
which caused the two men to hesitate, not knowing what would
be considered their “duty” under present circumstances.</p>

<p>A much less noble fate than assassination was reserved for
us. The wretches, although otherwise well armed, were not
holding revolvers in their hands as I first supposed. They
were furnished with huge garden-syringes charged with the
most disgusting filth, in the preparation of which they took
especial pains. So kindred to their own base natures was such
an act, that I doubt not they found it quite a labour of love.
The moment the syringes were pointed at us, my husband,
thinking a shot was coming, moved his head, and thus to a
certain extent escaped the full force of the discharge. I, however,
was not so fortunate. My hair, bonnet, face, clothes,
person—every inch of my body, every shred that I wore—were
in an instant saturated, from head to foot.</p>

<p>The villains, when they had perpetrated this disgusting and
brutal outrage, turned and fled. We ran after them for some
little distance, but we had no arms and nothing with which
to defend ourselves; in fact, we pursued them instinctively
rather than with any idea of overtaking them. There was
another man standing a little distance off in the direction in
which they were running, and we could not tell how many
might be concealed. The place, too, was dark and lonely, for
they had gone behind the Temple block—a fit corner for murderers
to skulk in; a convenient spot for the commission of
any unholy deed. I was burning with indignation, and longed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
to revenge myself upon the brutal cowards who had assaulted
us. In my anger I called upon them to come and kill us outright,
for I would have preferred death to such an indignity.
I almost wonder that they did not take me at my word and
return and finish their foul work, for they have long acted
upon the principle that “dead men tell no tales.”</p>

<p>I shall never forget that night. I declared that henceforth
I would tear from my heart every association, every memory,
every affection, which still remained to bind me to Mormonism;
not one solitary link should be left. Henceforth I
would be the declared and open enemy of the Priesthood. To
the utmost of my power—weak though I might be—I would
arouse the women of Utah to a sense of the wrongs which
they endured; I would proclaim to the world the disgrace
which Mormonism is to the great American nation, the foul
blot that it is upon Christianity and the civilization of the
age!</p>

<p>My son-in-law, Joseph A. Young, on the night of the attack,
offered a reward to the chief of the police for the apprehension
of the ruffians; but we knew well enough they would
never be discovered. A few Gentile friends also offered a
reward of five hundred dollars for any evidence that might
lead to their identification; but nothing, of course, was
elicited.</p>

<span class="smaller">AMUSING TROUBLES OF MY TALKATIVE FRIEND—CHARLOTTE
WITH THE GOLDEN HAIR!</span></h2>

<p>Not long after our separation from the Mormon Church, I received
another visit from my talkative friend.</p>

<p>As, according to her custom, she was making a preliminary
“fuss” at the door before entering, I heard her voice, and was
at a loss to conjecture whether she came for the purpose of
lamenting my apostasy and entreating my immediate return to
the bosom of the Church, or to condole with me concerning the
brutal outrage to which we had been subjected. In both suppositions
I was, however, mistaken—she came to talk about
her own woes.</p>

<p>“You’ll be surprised, my dear Sister Stenhouse,” she said,
“to see me looking so utterly miserable. I’m sure I must look
the picture of despair, and I feel it. You don’t know what
I’ve been suffering, and how shamefully I have been used.”</p>

<p>“You look very well I think, but I’m sorry to hear you
have met with any difficulty,” said I, when she stopped for a
moment to take breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, you may say so,” she replied, “but you know you
don’t think so in your heart. Why, I did not even stop to put
on my bonnet straight,” she said, stealing a look at the glass,
“and I ran all the way here, for I felt as if I should die if I
could not pour my sorrows into the bosom of some faithful-hearted
friend. Oh, I have been treated shamefully, and I
feel it the more as you know what a reserved woman I am, and
how seldom it is that I open my lips about family matters, even
to my dearest friends!”</p>

<p>“Well, but,” I said, “what really is the matter? You have
not yet told me what your trouble is.”</p>

<p>“Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “you have had a few little
vexations in the course of your life, I know, but they are
nothing to compare to the frightful indignities that I have
suffered in the course of the last few days. I never thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
I should come to this! I hate every man in the place, and I
detest my husband most of all, and I loathe his wives, and I
execrate Brother Brig—”</p>

<p>“Why, Sister Ann, what can have happened?” I exclaimed,
interrupting her.</p>

<p>“Happened!” she cried, starting from her chair in indignation,
“I tell you, Sister Stenhouse, nothing has ‘<em>happened</em>’—nothing
was done by chance—he did it all with his eyes open
and against my advice—I tell you he did it on <em>purpose</em>!”</p>

<p>“Did <em>what</em>?” I asked, “and <em>who</em> was it that did it?” But by
this time I had begun to form a shrewd guess <em>who</em> the culprit was.</p>

<p>“Why, he married that wretched little shrimp of a girl, with
blue eyes and red hair, and a die-away, lackadaisical manner—it
was <em>he</em>—my husband Henry—he married her this very day,
and I tell you he did it on purpose!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that it annoys you,” I said; “but really I am surprised,
after all you have said to me, that you should not care if
he had taken half-a-dozen wives, to say nothing of the one he
married this morning, and who you say is only a very little one.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter the size, Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “but
the colour of the eyes and the shade of the hair matters a great
deal. If that miserable little minx had had black hair or green
eyes, I daresay Henry would not have cared two straws about
her, unless he had done it out of sheer perversity, for all men
are made of the same contrary stuff. But he dotes on blue
eyes; I heard him myself tell her so one day, when I was listening
to them through the crack of the door, and they didn’t
know I was so near. But my wounded feelings would not
suffer me to remain silent, and I bounced in, and, said I,
‘Henry, how dare you talk such outrageous nonsense to that
child in my presence?’</p>

<p>“‘But I didn’t know you were present,’ he said.</p>

<p>“‘I tell you,’ said I, ‘I’m quite disgusted with you; a man
with three wives—and <em>me</em> one of them—to go talking twaddle
to a little chattering hussy like that, with her cat’s eyes and
her red hair!’</p>

<p>“‘Golden hair, my dear,’ he said, ‘Charlotte’s hair is golden.’</p>

<p>“‘I say <em>red!</em>—it’s straight, staring <em>red</em>—as red as red can
be,’ I told him; and then we had a regular fight over it. I
don’t mean that we came to blows, but we had some hot words,
and he went out and left us two alone. Then that young hussy
was impudent, and I don’t know how it was, but somehow,
when we left off our conversation, I found some of Charlotte’s
red hair between my fingers; and there”—she said, innocently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
holding out quite a respectable sized tuft of auburn hair—“there;
I put it to you, Sister Stenhouse, <em>is</em> that red, or is it
not?”</p>

<p>I was about to reply; but, without waiting an instant, she
dashed the stolen locks to the ground, and said, “I daresay,
Sister Stenhouse, you think me a little hasty, and yet among
my friends I’ve always been quite proverbial for the calmness
and evenness of my temper; but I’ve been tried very much
lately, and—if only you would not keep interrupting me, dear!—if
you’d just allow <em>me</em> to say a word or two in my turn!—I’d
tell you something that would open your eyes to the ingratitude
and wickedness of men. I don’t wonder that you have
left the Church; I am thinking of doing so myself, and you
won’t wonder at it when you hear what I’ve got to say. What
do you say to <em>my</em> leaving the Church? Won’t people be
astonished? But I declare, Sister Stenhouse, I <em>do</em> seriously
mean to leave the Church as soon as I get my new bonnet—”</p>

<p>“Why your new bonnet?” I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because, dear, I shall become an object of interest. All
the sisters will have their eyes upon me, and even Gentiles
will say, ‘There’s a lady who had courage to leave the
Mormon Church and quit an ungrateful husband who was not
worthy of her.’ And you know, Sister Stenhouse, it would not
do to have people looking at me and talking about me before I
got my new bonnet.”</p>

<p>This was a rather amusing reason for delay in changing
one’s religion, but it was quite characteristic of my friend. So
I humoured her a little, and tried to get her to explain how it
all came about.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said, “I ought to have told you that before,
but I was to angry at what had just happened that I forgot
everything else. The fact is, my husband is <em>a man</em>, and there’s
no calculating what a man will do. Women, you know, are
proverbial for the constancy of their affections and their slowness
in changing their minds—you know when you’re talking
to a woman that she <em>is</em> a woman, and you know exactly what
to do with her; but with a man it’s quite different. You
can’t calculate a man—you can’t fathom him. When you’ve
been thinking one way and another, and at last begin to
fancy you know what to do, why then, a man—if it’s him
you’ve got to do with—will turn just round, and while you’ve
been making everything smooth for him to do one thing, he’ll
go and do exactly the opposite. I know what men are by
this time, and I speak from experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was just so with Henry and this girl. He has gone
quite against the grain with me, and I feel it all the more because
he used to be so quiet and anxious to do exactly what I
wanted. But he doesn’t care a fig now whether I’m pleased
or not—he only thinks about this red-headed girl. In fact,
he’s quite crazy about her, and if there’s any sin in apostasy,
you may remember that it was he who drove me into it.”</p>

<p>“That seems hardly fair,” I said, “for you knew all along
that it was his privilege to take more wives.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true,” she exclaimed; “it <em>is</em> his privilege to
take wives, but it’s <em>my</em> privilege to choose them for him. I’m
a good Mormon, and I don’t mind how many wives my husband
takes, if he’ll only act reasonably about getting them.
But, Sister Stenhouse, I do <em>not</em> want a parcel of girls about the
house. I’m so far from wishing to usurp authority, that, as I
told Henry, I would not mind if his wives were even a little
older than me, but I won’t have them younger. It makes
Henry look so silly. Why, to see him with that girl Charlotte,
now, who isn’t more than half my own age—no; I don’t mean
that, I mean she’s slightly younger than I am—you might
really almost imagine that he thought more of her than he
does of me. I know he doesn’t, for he has told me so; but
any one to see them together would get quite a wrong impression.”</p>

<p>“When did he marry Charlotte?” I asked. “You spoke
so hastily, Sister Ann, that I did not quite understand you.”</p>

<p>“When? Why he married her this morning, as I thought
I told you; he has only just done it. He said he was anxious
to be in a quiet state of mind to-day, so I gave him a piece of
<em>my</em> mind, and he was so astonished at the pointed way in
which I explained to him what a fool he’d been making of
himself that he quite showed it in his face. The fact is, Sister
Stenhouse, he has lately become rather more than I could
manage.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sister,” I said, “I should have thought that his
finding a wife for himself would have saved you a world of
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no, Sister Stenhouse,” she replied; “it was trouble
I did not want to be saved. Men have no business, in my
opinion, to choose their own wives, after the first. I know the
men do do it, one and all; but it’s a shameful stretch of authority.
I should like to know whether it is not of much
more consequence to me what wife my husband has than it is
to him? However, I resolved that my husband should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
marry the red-headed girl, and I told him so; and what do you
think the inhuman creature said? ‘You’ve been persuading
me all these years,’ he said, ‘to take another wife, although
I’ve already got three, and now I’ve begun to do so you blame
me. I think I’ve as good a right as any one to say who I’ll
marry and who I won’t.’ Did you ever hear of such ingratitude?
Would you hear of such a thing from <em>your</em> husband,
Sister Stenhouse?”</p>

<p>I told her that with Mormonism my husband had given up
Polygamy, and she continued:</p>

<p>“Well, I tried to bring him to reason, but it was of no use.
And then I told him that the girl should never set foot inside
the house while I was in it. This was a very unfortunate
speech, for I do believe that up to that time he wanted as
much as possible to keep the girl out of my way; but the
moment I said that, to show his dignity, I suppose, he declared
that she should come to tea with us that very afternoon, and
he would go and fetch her; and he did so. I wouldn’t go
down to tea at first, though both the other wives were there
and he sent up for me, but my pride would not allow me to
stoop. At last I got tired of being all alone, and as it occurred
to me that perhaps they might be enjoying themselves without
me, I resolved to go down and see if I could not do
something to annoy them. Down I went, and Henry, all
smiling, introduced the girl to me as ‘Sister Charlotte,’ talking
of her as if he had known her for years. Was it not shameful?”</p>

<p>“It must have been very awkward for you,” I said.</p>

<p>“It was indeed, Sister Stenhouse, and I soon made it
awkward for <em>them</em>. I assure you, after I joined them, there
was not a soul present who had a moment’s comfort till that
girl went away. My husband, however, took her home, and
from that very day he seemed resolved to have the upper
hand. He never for a moment would listen to a word I said
about the girl; he brought her in every evening and took her
to the theatre constantly, and paid her ten times more attention
than he ever paid me. I wasn’t jealous, Sister Stenhouse;
no one—as I said before—could ever suspect <em>me</em> of jealousy,
but I <em>did</em> hate that girl. If he had not loved her, I can’t say
whether I myself might not have liked her. But the very
fact of him loving her makes me detest her; but it’s only a
little proper pride on my part—I’m not in the least jealous,
oh dear no!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” she said, “I’ve borne enough
from those two to drive fifty women crazy with jealousy, and
things went on from bad to worse, until the other day when,
as I told you, we had that little unpleasantness. My husband,
when he came back, was downright angry, and made use of
shocking language, and told me that, if he could not have
peace in the house, he would have me board out by myself in
some other part of the city. He said that I had scratched
Charlotte’s face and torn out her hair; but that was quite
untrue, as I told him; and as for the hair which fell out, it
was all an accident. He said that Charlotte did not like such
accidents, and that he would not put up with it. He was very
cross and disagreeable all the rest of the day, and made me
quite miserable and broken-hearted; and the next day, to wind
it all up, he told me that he and Charlotte had arranged the
day of the wedding. I was forced to go over with him to the
Endowment House, to give him that detestable little vixen. I
tell you, Sister Stenhouse, I hate her; and oh, oh dear, what
<em>shall</em> I do now my husband has fallen in love with her!”</p>

<p>Here, to my infinite astonishment, she rose from her seat
and rushed about the room, wringing her hands and exclaiming,
“Oh dear! oh dear!” She then threw herself right
down on the couch and actually burst into tears, crying out,
“Oh dear, what shall I do with my Henry and that girl!”</p>

<p>After that I did not see her for several weeks, and then I
accidentally met her in the street, and asked her why she had
not called upon me lately.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sister Stenhouse,” she said, “I’m delighted to see you!
You’ve been constantly in my thoughts, but I’ve been so hard
at work—oh, <em>so</em> busy, that I really had not time for anything—not
even to apostatize. Then, too, you see I’ve had my
hands full. If you want to make a man slight one woman and
get tired of her, there’s nothing like putting a nicer woman
than her in his way. So I reconsidered the matter and resolved,
cost what it might, I’d get another wife for my husband
right away. I don’t care now whether she’s old or young,
ugly or pretty, so long as she cuts out that detestable red-headed
girl. I’ve run all over the town and rushed about
here and there, all for his sake, though he’ll never be grateful
for it; and now at last, do you know, dear, I really do think
I’ve got the girl I want. She’s all dark—dark hair, dark
eyes, dark complexion. If he marries her, as I mean him to
do, she’ll lead him a fine life, notwithstanding all her winning
ways. I wouldn’t stand in <em>his</em> shoes when she’s his wife; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
I know <em>I</em> shall be able to manage her, for I have a deeper
insight into character than he has, and a better command of
temper. She’ll teach Miss Charlotte to keep her place, and
she’ll make Henry mind too. It’ll do him good; I’ve done it
all out of love to him, not a spark of jealousy or ill-feeling, as
you are well aware.”</p>

<p>The idea of setting one wife against another, in order to
keep the peace, would appear in the case of my talkative
friend to have been successful; for, sure enough, six months
after the time of which I have just spoken, her Henry did
marry the dark beauty, and she and her auburn predecessor
presented an interesting contrast when they chanced to appear
in the street together in the company of their husband. There
did not seem to be much love lost between them.</p>

<p>Successful in her plans, and having, as she said, now
brought her Henry to reason, my talkative friend gave up all
idea of leaving the Church, and when I last saw her she said,
“I’m busy now looking after a likely girl, for I do think a
man in my Henry’s position ought to live his religion and have
<em>at least seven wives</em>!—seven, you know, is such a very lucky
number.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.<br />
<span class="smaller">AFTER WE LEFT THE CHURCH—INTERESTING FACTS AND
FIGURES—THE MORMONISM AND MORMONS OF TO-DAY.</span></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The world was all before them where to choose</div>
<div class="verse">Their place of rest: with Providence their guide,</div>
<div class="verse">They hand in hand, with trembling steps and slow,</div>
<div class="verse">Through Eden took their solitary way.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse right"><cite>Paradise Lost.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When we left the Mormon Church, we were not quite as
badly off as were our first parents when they began life,
although in some respects we certainly resembled them. The
world was all before us, and it was necessary that we also
should choose a place of rest; but it was by no means an
Eden from which we were dismissed—or, rather, had dismissed
ourselves—and in the matter of experience in the
thorny ways of that world in which we were about to begin
afresh the battle of existence, we certainly had the advantage
over the exiles from Paradise.</p>

<p>The crisis of our own lives had now arrived. The act of
sending in our resignation as members of the Church cut us
off from all the associations of the past and all the friendships
and pleasant intimacies of so many years. A great gulf
divided our by-gone life from the unknown future which lay
before us.</p>

<p>My husband was now made painfully aware that it was altogether
useless for him to attempt to carry on his paper; for
his subscribers, as I before stated, had been “counselled” to
discontinue taking it in. The <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> had had a very
large circulation, but as there was very little money in the
Territory, the yearly subscriptions were mostly paid at harvest
time, and many of them in grain. At the time, therefore,
when the paper was finally given up, the Mormon people, as
the book-keeper in Ogden informed me, owed about twenty
thousand dollars; but when it was discovered that we were
“Apostates,” the majority of them considered that they were
released from all obligations on that score, and my husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
being an easy, generous-minded man, most of them evaded
payment. The idea that, because we had left the Church, no
Saint was bound to pay us any debts which they might happen
at the time to owe, was the natural result of the teachings
of the Tabernacle. Apostates are delivered over to “the
buffetings of Satan,” and the Saints consider it is <em>their</em> duty
to begin in this world their master’s work of castigation. Any
ill turn that can be done to an Apostate is consequently a
good action in the opinion of the Mormons, and they neglect
no opportunity of showing that these are the sentiments which
influence them.</p>

<p>Although we had now left the Mormon Church, never to
return, my husband could not at once shake off entirely that
influence which had so long held him captive. His thoughts
and belief, his hopes and ambitions, had for a quarter of a
century all pointed in one direction, and the very idea of
rebellion on his part against the authority of the Priesthood,
would, but a very little while before the time of which I speak,
have been considered by him an utter impossibility. It was
impossible, in a few short months only, to undo the work of
five-and-twenty years—the best years of his life. He could
no longer remain in the Church or conscientiously support
Brigham Young; but he had not outgrown Mormonism sufficiently
to enable him to throw off the yoke entirely and make
his paper an opponent of Brigham and his faith. Could he
have done so, I think it is highly probable that the <cite>Telegraph</cite>
might yet have been saved, for I know that many of the more
influential of the Gentiles would have aided him materially in
such a course. As it was, nothing remained but to give it up
with the best grace he could.</p>

<p>Two offers in reference to the paper were received by Mr.
Stenhouse, and it remained for him to decide which he would
accept. One of them came from a Gentile, who proposed to
run it in opposition to Brigham Young, and the other came
from a certain Mr. Fuller, who had for some time been my
husband’s travelling agent, and was a very intimate friend of
John W. Young, Brigham’s youngest son by his first wife.
We knew that this Mr. Fuller had nothing beyond his salary;
but, as the friend of Brigham’s son, we thought that probably
it was the Prophet’s wish that he should have this paper, and
we believed that he was simply buying it for the Church. My
husband argued that, although he could no longer unite with
the Mormons, he could at least refrain from doing them any
injury; he therefore concluded that, rather than let the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
go into the hands of an avowed enemy, he would sell it to Mr.
Fuller, who, on account of his friendship for the Prophet’s
family, would, he presumed, try to be just to the people.</p>

<p>This, no doubt, was very conscientious and just, although,
of course, no Mormon would give my husband credit for entertaining
such sentiments. For my own part, I naturally
wished him to accept the offer that would pay him best, which
was that made by the Gentile. He could not, however, bring
his mind to do this. The paper, therefore, was sold to Mr.
Fuller, who ran it for a few months and then himself ran
away, leaving behind him debts enough to swallow up everything.
Thus ended the <cite>Telegraph</cite> under that name, but destined,
however, to rise again as the <cite>Salt Lake Herald</cite>—a paper
devoted to the interests of Brigham and the Priesthood. To
my husband it was an utter loss, but it was hardly fair that
his conscientious conduct should meet with such an ill return.</p>

<p>It was now necessary that some steps should be taken to
provide for our family. The reader may, perhaps, remember
that when we first arrived in Salt Lake City, as I stated, I
myself engaged in business until my husband was able to find
some suitable and profitable employment. When the <cite>Telegraph</cite>,
however, was established and proved such a great success,
and we were in a position of affluence, I considered—the
pressure of necessity being removed—that I should do well to
resign my own business connection and employ my time more
profitably in domestic affairs. This was a great relief to me,
for I always felt considerable repugnance to mixing with the
world in the way of business, while among my children and
attending to their wants and interests I found myself in my
own legitimate sphere. But there was now no alternative.
All interest in the <cite>Telegraph</cite> had been resigned; my husband’s
property had been wasted in an attempt to keep it up,
and he had nothing now to depend upon. Something must be
done, and I resolved that I would not be backward in bearing
my full share of the burden.</p>

<p>It was only natural that we should feel very much unsettled
in mind by the great change which had taken place in our
position, for it is no easy matter to cut asunder the ties and
associations of a lifetime. Any one suddenly changing his
religious faith would, to a certain extent, feel and understand
what I mean in this respect. But in reference to any ordinary
religion, the person forsaking it would probably experience
comparatively little alteration in his every-day life. In Mormonism
it is very different, especially to any one who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
occupied a prominent position among the Saints. To resign
our religion was to revolutionize our lives. Everything was
changed: the friends of years would look coldly on us and
avoid us; persons whom we had before shunned as Gentiles
or Apostates would be the only individuals who would regard
us with favour; our entire position in the midst of a most
exclusive community was completely reversed; in a word, we
ourselves were now “Apostates!”</p>

<p>Thinking to turn the current of his thoughts, and believing
that change would be beneficial to him, I suggested to my
husband that he should pay a visit to the Eastern States. In
New York I believed he could find employment which would
help to divert his thoughts from Mormon affairs, and, at the
same time, would be profitable to him in other respects. My
suggestion was acted upon, and my husband set out East,
while I prepared to engage again in the same business which
I had formerly conducted so successfully.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since I embraced Mormonism, I
mixed freely with Gentiles and those who had left the Church,
and it was not long before I found that this intercourse with
the outer world produced a marked and decided effect upon
my mind. My views were enlarged, and my thoughts became
more liberal in their tone. My husband’s letters showed me
that a similar change was taking place in him.</p>

<p>We were not the only Apostates from the Church at that
time. The New Movement, as the reaction against the
tyranny of Brigham Young was called, was then in progress;
and the minds of all intelligent Saints were led to reflect upon
the unheard-of claims of Brigham’s “Infallible” Priesthood.
At this time the Prophet endeavoured to rivet still more firmly
the fetters which bound his deluded followers, by establishing
“Zion’s Co-operative Mercantile Institution” and reviving
the “Order of Enoch.”</p>

<p>The Co-operative Institution was announced as a joint-stock
concern, established under the pretence that it would be a
benefit to the working classes, and all the members of the
Church were invited to purchase shares, which were sold at
twenty-five dollars each. The statement so often made by
Brigham and repeated by strangers, to the effect that the exorbitant
prices charged by Gentile merchants necessitated the
establishment of such an institution was, as every Mormon
knows, only a pretence, and a very shallow one too; for the
Walker Brothers and other merchants had, for many years,
supplied goods to Mormons and Gentiles alike, at what, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the circumstances, were reasonable and just prices; for the
railway not then being constructed, and every article of commerce
being of necessity carried across the Plains—a distance
of over a thousand miles—by horse-teams, prices were,
of course, very high, and would, if this circumstance were not
taken into consideration, appear extortionate. In fact, subsequently,
the “Co-operative” stores, which had started with
high rates, under the belief that every rival would be crushed,
were compelled to lower their prices to those of the Walker
Brothers, or, in spite of their faith, the Mormons would have
forsaken Brigham’s Institution for the sake of their pockets.
Many, in fact, did secretly go to Gentile stores, but they were
watched by the police and reported to the teachers.</p>

<p>That large Mormon store, in which Brigham Young had
such a heavy interest, was to become the parent establishment—the
fountain-head from which temporal blessings, in the shape
of cheap goods of every description, were to flow unto the
people. Each Ward was to have its own store, and there the
Saints of that Ward were expected to deal exclusively, and, as
the teachers said, “keep off Main street where the Gentile
stores were located.” These Ward-stores purchased their
goods from the parent store, where nothing was sold by retail.</p>

<p>All the lesser Mormon merchants were “counselled” to sell
out their stock to the Church, for just what the Church chose
to offer them, or dispose of it otherwise as best they could,
and then they might go farming, or on mission, or anything
else; but sell out they must, for they were plainly told that
they would not be allowed to carry on business in opposition to
the new Institution.</p>

<p>Now, instead of benefiting the poorer Saints, by supplying
goods to them at a small advance upon cost prices, as was at
first proclaimed to be the object of the “Co-op”—as the Institution
was briefly and familiarly called—the reverse was the
case, for competition was altogether banished. All the trade
of the Gentile merchants—with one or two exceptions—was
forcibly taken from them, for the people were not to trade in
any store without first looking to see if the sign of the Institution—a
picture of “The All-seeing Eye,” and the words
“Holiness unto the Lord” were over the doorway. How
often I have seen groups of country people straggling along,
with their heads thrown back and their eyes straining aloft in
eager quest of that sign, although perhaps their purchases
would only amount to a few yards of ribbon or a paper of
pins!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>No one can predict what the Church—otherwise Brigham—will
do, if money should chance to tempt him. In this case,
the parent Co-operative store turned, as I might say, traitor to
the Ward-stores—its own children—for no sooner had they
all been established, and had bought up all the old stock from
the parent store, than it was whispered abroad that the latter
was about to open in the retail line with a splendid stock of
new goods—to suit the Gentiles, of course; for the Saints
were not allowed to trade outside of their own Ward-stores,
where they were expected to buy up all the old goods. In
fact, in order to gain Gentile trade and fill the pockets of Brigham
and the leading Elders who really constituted the Institution
(and do so still), the same prices were asked at the parent
store as had been charged the poor confiding stock-holders of
the Ward-stores at wholesale. This, of course, caused great
dissatisfaction, and many of the Saints rebelled, declaring they
would go where they pleased to spend their money, when they
had any to spend. The Ward-stores, in consequence, were
obliged, at great loss, to lower their prices, and many were
utterly ruined. Others which had more capital tided over the
difficulty, and learned a lesson concerning the honesty of the
Church leaders which it is to be hoped did them good.</p>

<p>As an example of the way in which matters were managed,
I may instance a very old and infirm woman who was one of
their victims. She came to me one day and said, “Sister
Stenhouse, will you buy out my stock in the Co-operative store?
Our store has failed, and I have my twenty-five dollars’ worth
in my basket. I pitied her and asked her to let me see her
stock, and thereupon she brought out <em>a pound and a half of
nails!</em> I <em>did</em> buy out her stock, for I thought that the nails
might be handy to have in the house, although I did not give
her twenty-five dollars for them. Another person—a Frenchman,
whom I knew—bought a share, and when he saw certain
ruin looming over his Ward-store, he went to the head-quarters
and purchased twenty-five dollars’ worth of goods, and having
got them all secured, laid down his shareholders’ receipt in
payment and beat a hasty retreat. He was a fortunate man
and acted prudently, but alas! for the poor souls who ventured
all their little savings in these Church “Institutions” and
then were left to poverty and starvation.</p>

<p>About this time, also, it was that the Mormon women, under
the auspices of Eliza R. Snow and the Female Relief Society,
got up a petition to Mrs. Grant, begging her to use her
influence with the President in favour of a toleration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Polygamy. The names to that petition were affixed without
any reference to propriety or right. Hundreds of names were
copied from the books of the Society without any permission
being obtained, or even asked, of their owners. It was then,
as I before stated, that the names of the dead were actually
added as subscribers to the petition; and in one case, when a
lady mentioned that her dead daughter had never belonged to
the Church, as she died before her mother heard of Mormonism,
she was told that her daughter would now, of course, have
found out that Polygamy was the true order of domestic life
in heaven, and that she would certainly be willing to subscribe
if she could return to earth. Her name was, therefore,
added without any further ceremony, although she had been
dead a good many years.</p>

<p>In January, 1872, a counter-petition was got up by the
Gentile and Apostate ladies. It set forth the cruel bondage
which Polygamy inflicts upon women; spoke of the heartless
conduct of the Mormon leaders, and of the murders and other
foul crimes which had been committed by them or at their
instigation; showed that, should Utah become a State, under
the name of <i>Deseret</i>—which has ever been the ambition of
Brigham Young—there would be no protection for life or
property; stated that the authorities themselves had declared
that when statehood was conferred, Gentiles and Apostates
would have good cause to tremble; and, finally, prayed the
National Government to stretch forth its long arm of power
for the defence and protection of honest and law-abiding
citizens. This petition was signed by four hundred and forty
ladies of Utah, most of them members of the Mormon Church,
whose <em>real</em> names were all fairly and openly <em>affixed by their
own selves</em>. It was presented to the Senate by the Hon.
Schuyler Colfax—then Vice-President; was read, discussed,
and ordered to be printed. As might be supposed, it excited
a great deal of angry discussion on the part of the Church
authorities; and the following Sundays the names of those
who had signed were read out in the Tabernacle, and <em>strong</em>
remarks made upon their conduct, in order to intimidate them
and prevent others from following their example. The consequence
was that many of their husbands and sons were
threatened with loss of employment, and they were thus
forced to retract.</p>

<p>That same year a bill was brought into the Territorial
Legislature, providing that <em>boys of fifteen years of age and girls
of twelve might legally contract marriage</em>, with the consent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
their parents or guardians! In stating this disgraceful fact, I
feel certain that the reader who has never lived among the
Saints, and is not versed in Utah affairs, will think that I must
be mistaken in what I say. It is, however, I am sorry to say,
only too true, and the records of the Legislature will bear me
witness.</p>

<p>With the exception of the little literary efforts which I have
made from time to time to expose through the press the iniquity
of the “Celestial Order of Marriage,” no event of more than
personal and private interest has, since I left the Mormon
Church, interrupted the even tenor of my life. Last year,
however, I was able to deal another blow—weak, it might be,
but still it was a blow—directed at that false system against
which I have sworn eternal enmity. I lectured upon Mormon
Polygamy in Washington and Boston, and other large
cities, and attempted in my humble way to attract the attention
of the Gentile world to the iniquities of that terrible
superstition which, in Utah, has degraded womanhood and
wrecked the happiness of thousands of my deluded sisters. I
met with sympathy everywhere; and then, as now, I resolved
that efforts like these I would never relax until, if God
spared my life, I should see the last stone in the fabric of
Mormonism overturned and Mormon Polygamy counted among
the sins and follies of the past.</p>

<p>His literary work accomplished, my husband returned to
Salt Lake City. Looking back over the past, our Missionary
life and our faith in Brighamism seems like a dream, so difficult
is it for us to realize that we ever submitted our souls to
the slavery of the Priesthood or placed any credence in that
mass of folly, superstition, and licentiousness, known as Mormonism.
During all his efforts to obey counsel and build up
a “kingdom,” my husband, I know, never ceased to love me.
For the misery which he then, in—as I firmly believe—his
conscientious endeavours to live his religion, inflicted upon me,
I have long ago freely and fully forgiven him. I think that
during all that time he never ceased to entertain the fondest
affection for me; and, if he was foolishly confiding in those
who he believed were divinely authorized and speaking by inspiration,
can I blame him when I remember that I myself
was actuated by the same faith?</p>

<p>It was impossible to obliterate utterly the education and influences
of a whole life’s experience. That wall of partition—Polygamy—which
separated my husband from me for so many
years, is now for ever broken down. But the effects of Mormonism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
will, no doubt, though unconsciously to ourselves, tinge
the whole of our future life. We can never forget the past.
The mournful sympathy which, according to the poet, the Peri
at the gate of Paradise expressed over the sins and sorrows of
humanity, might, with a slight variation, be applied to our
own lives:—</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLII">L’ENVOI.</h2>

<p>In the preceding pages I have endeavoured to present to the
reader the story of my life’s experience in Mormonism and
Polygamy, and to place before him a truthful picture of the
doctrines and practices of the Saints.</p>

<p>Two objects influenced my mind when I first proposed to
write this volume. In the first place, I earnestly desired to
stir up my Mormon sisters to a just sense of their own position.
I longed to make them feel, as I do, the cruel degradation,
the humiliating tyranny, which Polygamy inflicts. I
wanted to arouse them to a sense of their own womanhood,
and a just appreciation of those rights and duties which, as
women, God has conferred upon them. I was anxious that
they should understand and know the inconsistency and folly
of that superstitious faith by which they have been so egregiously
deluded; that they might learn to hate and loathe the
falsely-named “Celestial” system of marriage; and rising in
honest indignation and disgust against the tyranny of the
oppressor, break asunder the yoke of bondage, cast from them
for ever the moral, religious, and social fetters wherewith
they are bound, and, walking in the light of truth, assert
their perfect equality with their sons, their husbands, their
fathers, and their brethren, and henceforth claim and occupy
that position which God assigned them, and which <em>by right</em> is
theirs!</p>

<p>In the second place, I was anxious to enlist for them the
sympathy of the Gentile world. Most strenuous efforts have
been made, large sums of money have been spent, and secret
intrigues, as well as open and honourable negotiations, have
been carried on for the purpose of obtaining admission for
Utah into the Union, under the title of <i>The State of Deseret</i>.
The name “Deseret” itself is taken from the Book of Mormon,
and is said to signify in the celestial tongue a honey-bee;
wherefore it is that the escutcheon of Utah Territory is a
bee-hive; and to grant that name “Deseret” alone would be a
concession to Mormon superstition. Out here in the Valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
of the Great Salt Lake we are perfectly well aware that, with
Utah once admitted as a State, it would be almost impossible
for Gentiles to live peaceably and safely among the Mormons;
and of this fact their leading men and their official organs
have repeatedly boasted. With Utah as a State, the enslavement
of the people to the Priesthood would be complete, and
the cruel bondage of Polygamy would be rivetted a thousand
times more firmly upon the unfortunate women. I was
anxious, therefore, to attract the attention of Congress and the
nation at large to these facts; that thus, when Mormon bills
and Mormon petitions, replete with falsified statistics, and
perverted, and—in many instances—utterly untrue, statements
are presented to the National Legislature, neither the representatives
of the nation nor the nation itself might be deceived
thereby. These were the two objects which I had
proposed to myself in writing my own experience as a wife
and mother among the Mormons, and I trust to some extent
at least I have realized them.</p>

<p>I send forth this little book with many earnest prayers and
many heartfelt aspirations that my Mormon sisters may be
benefited thereby. Out of the evil which man originates,
God alone can produce good; and I trust that my feeble
attempt to portray the cruel wrong which Polygamy inflicts
upon the women of Utah may excite the sympathy of every
man and woman whose influence may avail to hasten that
time when this relic of ancient barbarism may be utterly
rooted out before the advancing civilization of the age.</p>

<p>The night—the gloomy night of superstition—cannot last
for ever. Already there are signs of the coming dawn. The
time, I trust and pray, will not long be delayed when the veil
shall be removed from the eyes of the enslaved men and
women of our modern Zion, and they shall cast aside for ever
the yoke of the Priesthood. I trust that I shall yet live to see
the day when the Mormon wives and mothers shall awake to
a sense of their position and responsibilities, shall understand
that God never required that their womanhood should be degraded,
their love crushed out, and the holiest instincts of
their nature perverted; I trust to see them assert their inalienable
rights—their womanly prerogatives—their very
birthright itself; I trust to see them shake off the slavery of
that cruel superstition which has so long held them captive;
I trust to see them take their places side by side with Gentile
matrons—the honoured wives and mothers of the men of
Utah; I trust to see that dark shadow banished from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
features, banished from their hearts, banished from their lives;
I trust to see them <span class="smcap">Free</span>!</p>

<p>Full of love for them—my sisters, my friends, the companions
of my life hitherto, whose religion was once my own,
whose hopes and joys I have shared, whose sorrows and trials
have been also mine—with hopeful prayer I lay down my pen
and present my labours to the world. And if my humble
efforts shall have conduced, even in the smallest degree, to
keep one sister from entering into this sinful “Order”; if
they shall have aroused the women of Utah to investigate
the foundations of their faith, to calmly and impartially consider
the iniquities of the system of Polygamy, to renounce the
man-made slavery of the “Celestial Order”; if I shall be
found to have awakened in the minds of thinking men and
women a hatred for the licentious doctrine which enslaves the
wives and daughters of the Saints; if I have to any extent
enlisted active, practical sympathy in their behalf, I shall feel
that my endeavours have been abundantly rewarded, and that
my labours have not been bestowed in vain.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLIII">POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

<p>The publication of this book has probably contributed more to
bring the terrible realities of Mormon life to the knowledge of
the public, and to hasten their day of judgment, than has any
other human agency.</p>

<p>The officers of justice in Utah were from that time urged to
bring the notorious criminals to justice, but many well-contrived
plans for their arrest failed in the accomplishment.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, John D. Lee, the hero of the Mountain
Meadows Massacre, was, while visiting one of his wives, surprised
and placed under confinement in the U.S. Military Fort
near Beaver City.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1875 a lengthy trial ensued, and as
there were Mormons among the jurors, they failed to agree in
a verdict.</p>

<p>Public indignation grew intensely against the system of
falsehood constantly practised by the Mormon jurors, when
the Church or any of its leaders were interested in the courts,
and a second trial of John D. Lee was earnestly demanded.</p>

<p>During his first trial the Apostle George A. Smith, Brigham’s
favourite and counsellor, who was undoubtedly the
instrument through whom Lee and his associates had been
“counselled” to destroy the emigrants, was still living, and
to screen him it was necessary that Lee should escape the
penalty of his crime.</p>

<p>Between the first and second trials of John D. Lee, Smith
died, and Lee might now confess what he pleased, for the
link in the chain of communication from Brigham Young to
the murderers was for ever broken.</p>

<p>Continually striving to gain the admission of Utah into the
Union as a State, and being always met with a repulse based
upon the wholesale murder crimes in Utah that had gone unpunished,
Brigham, having no longer anything to fear from Lee’s
confessions of his (Brigham’s) complicity in the Mountain Meadows
Massacre, resolved to sacrifice Lee to appease the public
clamour; accordingly the testimony from eye-witnesses was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
overwhelming, and Lee was condemned by his own Mormon
brethren, who for nearly twenty years had carried in their
minds this guilty evidence.</p>

<p>Lee was sentenced to be executed on the 23rd of March,
1877, and as he had the choice of the manner of his death, he
elected to be shot. The court so approved, and ordered him
to be, on the day named, taken to the Mountain Meadows, where
the great slaughter of the innocent men, women, and children,
had been consummated, to there meet his doom.</p>

<p>How truthfully I had told the story of this great crime will be
seen in the confession of Lee before his execution; and what a
dreadful commentary that document is on the Mormon Priesthood
will be apparent to every intelligent reader.</p>

<p>Under the name of a Prophet of Jesus Christ, Brigham
Young could rule with unchallenged sway hundreds of thousands
of honest men and women, who were born of Christian parents,
and trained in the civilized customs of Europe and America!</p>

<p>It would seem impossible, yet it is within this book revealed
to be an astounding and humiliating fact.</p>

<p>In the escort conducting Lee to the place of execution there
were in all about eighty persons, one of whom was a photographer,
who deemed the circumstance worthy perpetuation
by the unerring camera. From one of those present I copy
the sketch of the ending of John D. Lee.</p>

<p>It was Friday morning when the party stopped at their destination,
and Lee was immediately ordered to descend from the
waggon in which he rode, which he did without delay.</p>

<p>Marshal Nelson then read the orders of the court regarding
the execution, and when the reading was concluded, Lee was
asked if he had anything to say. Just at this moment the
photographer was arranging his camera to take a picture of the
prisoner. Lee caught sight of him, and pointing to him said,
“I want to see that man,” and added in a louder voice, addressed
to the photographer, “Come over here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fennimore, the artist, replied, “In a second, Mr. Lee,”
and very soon after was by the side of Lee, who said,—</p>

<p>“I want to ask a favour of you, sir; I want you to furnish
each of my three wives with a copy of the photograph—one to
Rachel A., Emma B., and Sarah C.”</p>

<p>He had had in all eighteen wives; but only the three
named remained. Rachel was the oldest and most faithful to
his interests.</p>

<p>The artist consented to do as he had been requested,
and Lee then sat for his picture, which was successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
taken. Then he arose and, looking over those standing about,
said,—</p>

<p>“I have but little to say this morning. Of course, I feel
that I am upon the brink of eternity, and the solemnity of
eternity should rest upon my mind at the present moment. I
have made out, or endeavoured to do so, a manuscript and an
abridged history of my life. This will be published. Sir,
[turning to District Attorney Howard] I have given my views
and feelings with regard to all these things. I feel resigned
to my fate. I feel as calm as a summer morning. I have
done nothing adversely wrong. My conscience is clear before
God and man, and I am ready to meet my Redeemer. This
it is that places me on this field. I am not an infidel; I have
not denied God or His mercy. I am a strong believer in
these things. The most I regret is parting with my family.
Many of them are unprotected, and will be left fatherless.
When I speak of those little ones, they touch a tender chord
within me.”</p>

<p>At this moment his voice trembled, and he perceptibly faltered
in his words. He continued, however, as follows:—</p>

<p>“I have done nothing designedly wrong in this affair. I
used my utmost endeavours to save those people. I would
have given worlds were they at my command to have avoided
that calamity, but I could not. I am sacrificed to satisfy feelings,
and am used to gratify parties; but I am ready to die.
I have no fear of death. It has no terrors for me; and no
particle of mercy have I asked for from court or officials to
spare my life. I do not fear death. I shall never go to a
worse place than the one I am now in. I have said it to my
family, and I will say it to-day, that the Government of the
United States sacrifices their best friend, and that is saying a
great deal; but it is true. I am a true believer in the Gospel
of Jesus Christ. I do not believe everything that is now practised
and taught by Brigham Young. I do not agree with
him. I believe he is leading his people astray. But I believe
in the gospel as taught in its purity by Joseph Smith in former
days. I have my reasons for saying this. I used to make
this man’s will my pleasure (evidently alluding to Brigham
Young), and did so for thirty years. See how and what I
have come to this day! I have been sacrificed in a cowardly,
dastardly manner. There are thousands of people in the
Church—honourable, good-hearted—whom I cherish in my
heart. I regret to leave my family. They are near and dear
to me. These are things to rouse my sympathy. I declare I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
did nothing designedly wrong in this unfortunate affair. I
did everything in my power to save all emigrants, but I am
the one that must suffer. Having said this I feel resigned.
I ask the Lord, my God, to extend His mercy to me and receive
my spirit. My labours are here done.”</p>

<p>This ceremony, altogether, had occupied about an hour, and
it was now close upon eleven o’clock. The sun, which had
been fitfully bright during the morning, had become veiled
behind a passing cloud, yet the sky was only partially overcast,
as down the horizon were bright streaks of golden light; and
the effect of light and shadow, as portrayed upon the scene,
soon to culminate in the execution of the law, was one that
seemed to be in full harmony with the painful silence that
prevailed. Then it was that the words upon the rude monument,
which once had stood to mark the spot of the massacre,
came out with vivid force—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The stillness of the occasion was broken by Lee’s seating
himself, according to orders, upon the coffin provided for his
burial. He tried to appear calm as he faced the squad of soldiers
whose rifles were soon to discharge their contents into
his body. A Methodist preacher, Parson Stokes, then knelt
beside the coffin and offered a short prayer, following which a
white handkerchief was placed over Lee’s eyes. While the
marshal was arranging the handkerchief, Lee said in a low but
firm tone of voice—“Let them shoot the balls through my
heart; don’t let them mangle my body.”</p>

<p>He was assured that the aim would be as true as possible,
and the marshal then stepped back and gave his order to the
five riflemen who had been selected to do the work,—</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Ready! Aim! Fire!</span>”</p>

<p class="noindent">The men made ready by raising their weapons to the shoulder,
and then took deliberate aim at the blindfolded man, who was
about twenty feet off, and at the word “fire!” the volley was
discharged, with but a single sound perceptible to the ear, and
Lee fell back upon the coffin, dead, without a cry or even a
moan. He was shot through the heart, as he had hoped to
be, and died instantly. The marshal, after a few moments,
viewed the body, and said: “He is quite dead; the law is
satisfied at last.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE—COMPLETE CONFESSION
OF BISHOP JOHN D. LEE.</span></h2>

<p>In the month of September, 1857, the company of emigrants,
known as the “Arkansas Company,” arrived at Parowan,
Iron county, Utah, on their way to California. At Parowan
young Aden, one of the company, saw and recognized one
William Laney, a Mormon resident of Parowan. Aden and
his father had rescued Laney from an anti-Mormon mob in
Tennessee several years before, and saved his life. He
(Laney) at the time he was attacked by the mob was a Mormon
missionary in Tennessee. Laney was glad to see his
friend and benefactor, and invited him to his house and gave
him some “garden sauce” to take back to the camp with him.
The same evening, it was reported to Bishop (Colonel) Dame,
that Laney had given potatoes and onions to the man Aden,
one of the emigrants. When the report was made to Bishop
Dame, he raised his hand and crooked his little finger in a significant
manner to one Barney Carter, his brother-in-law, and
one of the “Angels of Death.” Carter, without another word,
walked out, went to Laney’s house with a long picket in his
hand, called Laney out and struck him a heavy blow on the
head, fracturing his skull, and left him on the ground for dead.
C. Y. Webb and Isaac Naoman, President of the “High Council,”
both told me they saw Dame’s manœuvres. James
McGuffee, then a resident of Parowan, but through oppression
has been forced to leave there and is now a merchant in Pahranagat
Valley, near Pioche, Nev., knows these facts. About
the last of August, 1857, some ten days before the Mountain
Meadows Massacre, the company of emigrants passed through
Cedar City. George A. Smith, then first counsellor in the
Church and Brigham Young’s right-hand man, came down
from Salt Lake City, preaching to the different settlements.
I at that time was in Washington county, near where St. George
now stands. He sent for me. I went to him and he asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
me to take him to Cedar City by way of Fort Clara and Pinto
settlements, as he was on business and must visit all the settlements.
We started on our way up through the canyon.
We saw herds of Indians, and he (George A. Smith) remarked
to me that these Indians, with the advantages they
had of the rocks, could use up a large company of emigrants,
or make it very hot for them. After pausing for a short time
he said to me, “Brother Lee, what do you think the brethren
would do if a company of emigrants should come down through
here making threats? Don’t you think they would pitch into
them?” I replied that “they certainly would.” This seemed
to please him, and he again said to me, “And you really
think the brethren would pitch into them?” “I certainly
do,” was my reply, “and you had better instruct Colonel
Dame and Haight to tend to it that the emigrants are permitted
to pass, if you want them to pass unmolested.” He
continued, “I asked Isaac (meaning Haight) the same
question, and he answered me just as you do, and I expect
the boys would pitch into them.” I again said to him that he
had better say to Gov. Young that if he wants emigrant companies
to pass without molestation that he must instruct Col.
Dame or Major Haight to that effect; for if they are not
ordered otherwise they will use them up by the help of the
Indians. He told the people at the Clara not to sell their
grain to the emigrants, nor to feed it to their animals, as they
might expect a big fight the next spring with the United
States. President Young did not intend to let the troops
into the territory. He said: “We are going to stand up for
our rights, and will no longer be imposed upon by our enemies,
and want every man to be on hand with his gun in good order
and his powder dry,” and instructed the people to part with
nothing that would sustain life. From the 1st to the 10th
of September, 1857, a messenger came to me—his name was
Sam Wood—and told me that President Isaac C. Haight
wanted me to be at Cedar City that evening without fail.
This was Saturday. He told me that a large company of
emigrants had gone south. I think he lived at Harmony,
twenty miles south of Cedar City.</p>

<p>I obeyed the summons. President Haight met me. It
was near sundown. We spent the night in an open house on
some blankets, where we talked most all night. He told me
that a company of emigrants had passed through some two
days before, threatening the Mormons with destruction, and
that one of them had said he had helped to kill old Joe Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and his brother Hyrum, that other members of the company
of emigrants had helped drive the Mormons out of Missouri;
that others had said they had come to help Johnson’s army
clean the Mormons out of Utah; that they had the halters
ready to hang old Brigham and Heber, and would have them
strung up before the snow flew; that one of the emigrants
called one of his oxen (a pair of stags) “Brig.” and the other
“Heber;” and that several of the emigrants had used all
kinds of threats and profanity. John M. Higbee, the City
Marshal, had informed them that it was a breach of the city
ordinance to use profane language, whereupon one of them
replied that he did not care a —— for the Mormon laws or
the Mormons either; that they had fought their way through
the Indians, and would do it through the —— Mormons;
and if their god, old Brigham, and his priests would not sell
their provisions, by —— they would take what they wanted
any way they could get it; that thus enraged, one of them let
loose his long whip and killed two chickens, and threw them
into the waggon; that the widow Evans said, “Gentlemen,
those are my chickens; please don’t kill them; I am a poor
widow;” that they ordered her to “shut up,” or they would
blow her —— brains out, etc.; that they had been raising
trouble with all the settlements and Indians on their way;
that we were threatened on the North by Johnson’s army;
that now our safety depended on prompt and immediate action;
that a company of Indians had already gone South
from Parowan and Cedar City to surprise the emigrants, who
were then at the Mountain Meadows, and he wanted me to
return home in the morning (Sunday), and send Carl Schurtz
(Indian interpreter) from my home (Harmony), to raise the
Indians South, at Harmony, Washington, and Santa Clara, to
join the Indians from the North and make the attack upon
the emigrants at the Meadows. I said to him, “Would it
not be well to hold a council of the brethren before making
a move?” He replied that “every true Latter-Day Saint
that regarded their covenants knew well their duty, and that
the company of emigrants had forfeited their lives by their
acts,” and that Bishop P. K. Smith (Klingensmith) and Joel
White had already gone by way of Pinto, to raise the Indians
in that direction, and those that had gone from Parowan and
here would make the attack, and might be repulsed. “We
can’t now delay for a council of the brethren. Return immediately,
and start Carl Schurtz; tell him that I ordered you to
tell him to go; and I want you to try and get there before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
attack is made, and make the plan for the Indians, and will
send Nephi Johnson, the interpreter, to the Meadows as soon
as he can be got to help Carl Schurtz manage the Indians.”
I did just as I was ordered. The Indians from the North and
about Harmony had already started for the Meadows before
I reached home. Schurtz started immediately to do his part.</p>

<p>I arrived at home in the night, and remained till morning.
I thought over the matter, and the more I thought the more
my feelings revolted against such a horrid deed. Sleep had
fled from me. I talked to my wife Rachel about it. She felt
as I did about it, and advised me to let them do their own
dirty work, and said that if things did not go just to suit them
the blame would be laid on me. She never did believe in
blood atonement, and said it was from the devil, and that she
would rather break such a covenant, if she had to die for so
doing, than to live and be guilty of doing such an act. I
finally concluded that I would go; that I would start by daybreak
in the morning, and try to get there before an attack
was made on the company, and use my influence with the
Indians to let them alone. I crossed the mountains by a trail,
and reached the Meadows between nine and ten in the morning,
the distance from my place being about twenty-five
miles. But I was too late. The attack had been made just
before daybreak in the morning, the Indians repulsed, with
one killed and two of their chiefs from Cedar City shot
through the legs, breaking a leg for each of them. The
Indians were in a terrible rage. I went to some of them that
were in a ravine. They told me to go to the main body, or
they would kill me for not coming before the attack was
made. While I was standing there I received a shot just
above the belt, cutting through my clothes to the skin, some
six inches across. The Indians with whom I was talking
lived with me at Harmony. I was Indian Farmer. They
told me I was in danger, and to get down into the ravine. I
said that it was impossible for me to do anything there, and I
dare not venture to the camp of the emigrants without endangering
my life. I mounted my horse and started south
to meet Carl Schurtz. I travelled sixteen miles and stopped
on the Megotsy to bait my animal, as there was good grass
and water. I had rode over forty miles without eating or
drinking. This is the place where Mr. Tobin met his assassinators.
About sunset I saw Schurtz and some ten or
fifteen white men and about one hundred and fifty Indians.
We camped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night the Indians left for the Meadows. I
reported to the men what had taken place. They attacked
the emigrants again, about sunrise the next morning, which
was Tuesday, and had one of their number killed and several
wounded. I, with the white men, reached the Meadows about
one o’clock p.m. On the way we met a small band of
Indians returning, with some eighteen or twenty head of
cattle. One of the Indians was wounded in the shoulder.
They told me that the Indians were encamped east of the
emigrants, at some springs. On our arrival at the springs we
found some two hundred Indians, among whom were the two
wounded chiefs, Moqueetus and Bill. The Indians were in a
high state of excitement; had killed many cattle and horses
belonging to the company. I counted sixty head near their
encampment, that they had killed in revenge for the wounding
of their men. By the assistance of Oscar Hamblin (brother
of Jacob Hamblin) and Schurtz, we succeeded in getting the
Indians to desist from killing any more stock that night.
The company of emigrants had corraled all their waggons but
one for better defence. This corral was about one hundred
yards above the springs. This they did to get away from the
ravine and from the rocks on the west. The attack was
renewed that night by the Indians, in spite of all we could do
to prevent it.</p>

<p>When the attack commenced, Oscar Hamblin, William
Young, and myself started to go to the Indians. When opposite
the corral, on the north, the bullets came around us like a
shower of hail. We had two Indians with us to pilot us; they
threw themselves flat on the ground to protect themselves
from the bullets. I stood erect and asked my Father in
heaven to protect me from the missiles of death, and enable
me to reach the Indians. One ball passed through my hat
and the hair of my head, and another through my shirt, grazing
my arm near the shoulder. A most hideous yell of the Indians
commenced. The cries and shrieks of the women and children
so overcame me that I forgot my danger and rushed
through the fire to the Indians, and pleaded with them, in
tears, to desist. I told them that the Great Spirit would be
angry with them for killing women and little children. They
told me to leave or they would serve me the same way, and
that I was not their friend, but a friend of their enemies;
that I was a squaw, and did not have the heart of a brave,
and that I could not see blood shed without crying like a baby,
and called me cry-baby, and by that name I am known by all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the Indians to this day. I owe my life on that occasion to
Oscar Hamblin, who was a missionary with the Indians, and
had much influence with the Santa Clara Indians. They were
the ones that wanted to kill me. Hamblin shamed them, and
called them dogs and wolves for wanting to shed the blood of
their father (myself), who had fed and clothed them. We
finally prevailed on them to return to camp, where we would
hold a council; that I would send for big Captains to come
and talk. We told them that they had punished the emigrants
enough, and may be they had killed nearly all of them. We
told them that Bishop Dame and President Haight would
come, and may be they would give them part of the cattle,
and let the company go with the teams. In this way we
reconciled them to suspend hostilities for the present. The
two that had been with Hamblin and myself the night before
said they had seen two men on horseback come out of the
emigrant’s camp under full speed, and that they went toward
Cedar City.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning I asked a man—I think his name was
Edwards—to go to Cedar City and say to President Haight,
for God’s sake, for my sake, and for the sake of suffering
humanity, to send out men to rescue that company. This day
we all lay still, waiting orders. Occasionally a few of the
Indians withdrew, taking a few head of animals with them.
About noon I crossed the valley north of the corral, thinking
to examine their location from the west range. The company
recognized me as a white man, and sent two little boys, about
four years old, to meet me. I hid from them, fearing the Indians,
who discovered the children. I called the Indians, who
wanted my gun or ammunition to kill them. I prevailed with
them to let the children go back to camp, which they very
soon did when they saw the Indians. I crept up behind some
rock, on the west range, where I had a full view of the corral.
In it they had dug a rifle-pit. The wheels of their waggons
were chained together, and the only chance for the Indians
was to starve them out, or shoot them as they went for
water. I lay there some two hours, and contemplated their
situation, and wept like a child. When I returned to camp,
some six or eight men had come from Cedar City. Joel
White, William C. Stewart, and Elliot C. Weldon, were among
the number, but they had no orders. They had come merely
to see how things were. The Meadows are about fifty miles
from Cedar City. Thursday afternoon the messenger from
Cedar City returned. He said that President Haight had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
gone to Parowan to confer with Col. Dame, and a company of
men and orders would be sent on to-morrow (Friday); that up
to the time he had left, the council had come to no definite
conclusion. During this time the Indians and men were
engaged in broiling beef and making up their hides into lassos.
I had flattered myself that bloodshed was at an end. After
the emigrants saw me cross the valley, they hoisted a white
flag in the midst of their corral.</p>

<p>Friday afternoon four waggons drove up with armed men.
When they saw the white flag in the corral, they raised one
also, but drove to the springs where we were, and took refreshment,
after which a council meeting was called of Presidents,
Bishops, and other Church officers and members of the High
Council, societies, High Priests, &amp;c. Major John M. Higbee
presided as chairman. Several of the dignitaries bowed in
prayer, invoked the aid of the Holy Spirit to prepare their
minds, and guide them to do right, and carry out the counsels
of their leaders. Higbee said that “President J. C. Haight
had been to Parowan to confer with Col. Dame and their
counsel, and orders were that, this emigrant camp must be
used up.” I replied, “Men, women, and children?” “All,”
said he, “except such as are too young to tell tales; and if the
Indians cannot do it without help, we must help them.” I
commenced pleading for the company, and I said, though some
of them have behaved badly, they have been pretty well
chastised. My policy would be to draw off the Indians, let
them have a portion of the loose cattle, and withdraw with
them, under promise that they would not molest the company
any more; that the company would then have teams enough
left to take them to California. I told them that this course
could not bring them into trouble. Higbee said, “White
men have interposed, and the emigrants know it, and there
lies the danger in letting them go.” I said, “What white
man interfered?” He replied that in the attack on Tuesday
night two men broke out of the corral and started for Cedar
City on horseback; that they were met at Richey’s Spring
by Stewart, Joel White, and another man, whose name has
passed from me. Stewart asked the two men their names
when they met at the spring, and being told in reply by one of
the men that his name was Aden, and that the other was a
Dutchman from the emigrant’s company, Stewart shoved a
pistol to Aden’s breast, and killed him, saying, “Take that,
—— you.” The other man (the Dutchman) wheeled to leave
as Joel White fired and wounded him. I asked him how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
knew the wounded Dutchman got back to the emigrants’
camp. He said because he was tracked back, and they knew
he was there. I again said that it was better to deliver
the man to them, and let them do anything they wished with
them, and tell them that we did not approve such things.
Ira Allen, high councillor, and Robert Wiley, and others,
spoke, reproving me sharply for trying to dictate to the priesthood;
that it would set at naught all authority; that he would
not give the life of one of our brethren for a thousand such
persons. “If we let them go,” he continued, “they will raise
hell in California, and the result will be that our wives and
children will have to be butchered, and ourselves too, and
they are no better to die than ours, and I am surprised to hear
Brother Lee talk as he does, as he, who has always been considered
one of the staunchest in the Church, now is the first
to shirk from his duty.” I said, “Brethren, the Lord must
harden my heart before I can do such a thing.” Allen said,
“It is not wicked to obey counsel.” At this juncture I withdrew,
walked off some fifty paces, and prostrated myself on
the ground and wept in the bitter anguish of my soul, and
asked the Lord to avert that evil.</p>

<p>While in that situation Councillor C. Hopkins, a near friend
of mine, came to me and said, “Brother Lee, come, get up,
and don’t draw off from the priesthood. You ought not to do
so. You are only endangering your own life by standing out.
You can’t help it, if this is wrong; the blame won’t rest on
you.” I said, “Charley, this is the worst move this people
ever made; I feel it.” He said, “Come, go back, and let
them have their way.” I went back, weeping like a child, and
took my place, and tried to be silent, and was until Higbee
said, they (the emigrants) must be decoyed out through pretended
friendship. I could no longer hold my peace, and said
I, “Joseph Smith said that God hated a traitor, and so do I:
before I would be a traitor, I would rather take ten men, and
go to that camp and tell them they must die, and now to
defend themselves, and give them a show for their lives; that
would be more honourable than to betray them like Judas.”
Here I got another reproof, and was ordered to hold my peace.
The plan agreed upon there was to meet them with a flag of
truce, tell them that the Indians were determined on their
destruction; that we dare not oppose the Indians, for we were
at their mercy; that the best we could do for them (the emigrants)
was to get them and what few traps we could take in
the waggons, to lay their arms in the bottom of the waggon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
cover them up with bed-clothes, and start for the settlement
as soon as possible, and to trust themselves in our hands.
The small children and wounded were to go with the two
waggons, the women to follow the waggons, and the men next,
the troops to stand in readiness on the east side of the road ready
to receive them. Schurtz and Nephi Johnson were to conceal
the Indians in the brush and rocks till the company was strung
out on the road to a certain point, and at the watchword,
“Halt; do your duty!” each man was to cover his victim and
fire. Johnson and Schurtz were to rally the Indians, and rush
upon and despatch the women and larger children. It was
further told the men that President Haight said, if we were
united in carrying out the instructions, we would all receive
“celestial reward.” I said I was willing to put up with a less
reward if I could be excused. “How can you do this
without shedding innocent blood?” Here I got another lampooning
for my stubbornness and disobedience to the priesthood.
I was told that there was not a drop of innocent blood
in the whole company of emigrants. Also referred to the
Gentile nations who refused the children of Israel passage
through their country when Moses led them out of Egypt—that
the Lord held that crime against them, and when Israel
waxed strong the Lord commanded Joshua to slay the whole
nation, men, women, and children. “Have not these people
done worse than that to us? Have they not threatened to
murder our leaders and prophets, and have they not boasted
of murdering our patriarchs and prophets, Joseph and Hyrum?
Now talk about shedding innocent blood.” They said I was
a good, liberal, free-hearted man, but too much of this sympathy
would be always in the way; that every man now had
to show his colours; that it was not safe to have a Judas in
camp. Then it was proposed that every man express himself;
that if there was a man who would not keep a close
mouth, they wanted to know it then. This gave me to understand
what I might expect if I continued to oppose. Major
Higbee said, “Brother Lee is right. Let him take an expression
of the people.” I knew I dared not refuse; so I had
every man speak and express himself. All said they were
willing to carry out the counsel of their leaders; that the
leaders had the spirit of God, and knew better what was
right than they did. They then wanted to know my feelings.
I replied, I have already expressed them. Every eye was upon
me as I paused; “but,” said I, “you can do as you please; I
will not oppose you any longer.” “Will you keep a close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
mouth?” was the question. “I will try,” was my answer.
I will here say that the fear of offending Brigham Young and
George A. Smith had saved my life. I was near being “blood-atoned”
in Parowan, under J. C. L. Smith, in 1854, but on
this I have spoken in my autobiography.</p>

<p>Saturday morning all was ready, and every man assigned to
his post of duty. During the night, or rather just before daylight,
Johnson and Schurtz ambushed their Indians, the better
to deceive the emigrants. About 11 o’clock a.m. the troops
under Major Higbee took their position on the road. The
white flag was still kept up in the corral. Higbee called William
Bateman out of the ranks to take a flag of truce to the
corral. He was met about half way with another white flag
from the emigrants’ camp. They had a talk. The emigrant
was told we had come to rescue them if they would trust us.
Both men with flags returned to their respective places and
reported, and were to meet again and bring word. Higbee
called me out to go and inform them the conditions, and
if accepted, Dan McFarland, brother to John McFarland,
lawyer, who acted as aid-de-camp, would bring back word, and
then the waggons would be sent for the firearms, children, clothing,
etc. I obeyed, and the terms proposed were accepted,
but not without distrust. I had as little to say as possible;
in fact, my tongue refused to perform its office. I sat down
on the ground in the corral, near where some young men were
engaged in paying their last respects to some person who had
just died of a wound. A large fleshy old lady came to me
twice, and talked while I sat there. She related their troubles;
said that seven of their number were killed, and forty-seven
wounded on the first attack; that several had died since. She
asked me if I were an Indian agent. I said, “In one sense I
am, as Government has appointed me farmer to the Indians.”
I told her this to satisfy her. I heard afterwards that the same
question was asked and answered in the same manner by
McFarland, who had been sent by Higbee to the corral to “hurry
me up, for fear that the Indians would come back and be upon
them.”</p>

<p>When all was ready, Samuel McMurdy, counsel to Bishop
P. K. Smith (Klingensmith), drove out on the lead. His
waggon had the seventeen children, clothing, and arms.
Samuel Knight drove the other team, with five wounded men
and one boy about fifteen years old. I walked behind the
front waggon to direct the course, and to shun being in the heat
of the slaughter; but this I kept to myself. When we got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
turned fairly to the east, I motioned to McMurdy to steer
north, across the valley. I, at the same time, told the women,
who were next to the waggon, to follow the road up to the
troop, which they did. Instead of saying to McMurdy not
to drive so fast (as he swore on my trial), I said to the contrary,
to drive on, as my aim was to get out of sight before
the firing commenced, which we did. We were about half a
mile ahead of the company when we heard the first firing.
We drove over a ridge of rolling ground, and down on a
low flat. The firing was simultaneous along the whole line.
The moment the firing commenced McMurdy halted and
tied his lines across the rod of the waggon-box, stepped
down coolly with double-barrelled shot-gun, walked back to
Knight’s waggon, who had the wounded men, and was about
twenty feet in the rear. As he raised his piece, he said,
“Lord, my God, receive their spirits, for it is for the kingdom
of heaven’s sake that we do this,” fired and killed two men.
Samuel Knight had a muzzle-loading rifle, and he shot and
killed the three men, then struck the wounded boy on the head,
who fell dead. In the meantime I drew a five-shooter from
my belt, which accidentally went off, cutting across McMurdy’s
buskin pantaloons in front, below the crotch. McMurdy said,
“Brother Lee, you are excited; take things cool; you was
near killin’ me. Look where the bullet cut,” pointing to the
place in his pantaloons. At this moment I heard the scream
of a child. I looked up and saw an Indian have a little boy
by the hair of his head, dragging him out of the hind end of
the waggon, with a knife in his hand, getting ready to cut his
throat. I sprang for the Indian with my revolver in hand,
and shouted to the top of my voice, “Arick, oomo, cot too
sooet” (stop, you fool!). The child was terror-stricken.
His chin was bleeding. I supposed it was the cut of a knife,
but afterwards learned that it was done on the waggon-box, as
the Indian yanked the boy down by the hair of the head. I
had no sooner rescued this child than another Indian seized a
little girl by the hair. I rescued her as soon as I could speak;
I told the Indians that they must not hurt the children—that
I would die before they should be hurt; that we would buy
the children of them. Before this time the Indians had
rushed around the waggon in quest of blood, and despatched
the two runaway wounded men. In justice to my statement
I would say that if my shooter had not prematurely exploded,
I would have had a hand in despatching the five wounded. I
had lost control of myself, and scarce knew what I was about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
I saw an Indian pursue a little girl who was fleeing. He
caught her about one hundred feet from the waggon, and
plunged his knife through her. I said to McMurdy that he
had better drive the children to Hamblin’s ranch, and give
them some nourishment, while I would go down and get my
horse at the camp. Passing along the road I saw the dead
strung along the distance of about half a mile. The women
and children were killed by the Indians. I saw Schurtz with
the Indians, and no other white man with them. When I
came to the men, they lay about a rod apart. Here I came up
with Higbee, Bishop Smith, and the rest of the company.</p>

<p>As I came up, Higbee said to me, “Let us search these
persons for valuables,” and asked me to assist him; gave me
a hat to hold. Several men were already engaged in searching
the bodies. I replied that I was unwell, and wanted to
get upon my horse and go to the ranch and nurse myself.
My request was granted. Reaching Hamblin’s ranch—being
heartsick and worn out—I lay down on my saddle-blanket
and slept, and knew but little of what passed during the
night.</p>

<p>About daybreak in the morning, I heard the voices of Col.
Dame and Isaac C. Haight. I heard some very angry words
pass between them, which drew my attention. Dame said he
would have to report the destruction of the emigrant camp
and company. Haight said, “How, as an Indian massacre?”
Dame said he did not know so well about that. This reply
seemed to irritate Haight, who spoke quite loudly, saying,
“How the —— can you report it any other way without
implicating yourself?” At this Dame lowered his voice
almost to a whisper; I could not understand what he said, and
the conversation stopped.</p>

<p>I got up, saw the children, and among the others the boy
who was pulled by the hair of his head out of the waggon by
the Indian and saved by me; that boy I took home and kept
until Dr. Forney, Government agent, came to gather up the
children and take them East; he took the boy with the
others; that boy’s name was William Fancher; his father
was captain of the train; he was taken East and adopted by
a man in Nebraska, named Richard Sloan; he remained East
several years, and then returned to Utah, and is now a convict
in the Utah Penitentiary, having been convicted the past year
for the crime of highway robbery. He is now known by the
name of “Idaho Bill,” but his true name is William Fancher.
His little sister was also taken East, and is now the wife of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
a man working for the Union Pacific Railroad Company, near
Green River. The boy (now man) has yet got the scar on
his chin caused by the cut on the waggon-box, and those who
are curious enough to examine will find a large scar on the
ball of his left foot, caused by a deep cut made by an axe while
he was with me.</p>

<p>I got breakfast that morning. Then all hands returned to
the scene of the slaughter to bury the dead. The bodies were
all in a nude state. The Indians, through the night, had
stripped them of every vestige of clothing. Many of the
parties were laughing and talking as they carried the bodies
to the ravine for burial. They were just covered over a little,
but did not long remain so; for the wolves dug them up, and,
after eating the flesh from them, the bones laid upon the
ground until buried, some time after, by a Government military
officer. At the time of burying the bodies Dame and
Haight got into another quarrel. Dame seemed to be terror-stricken,
and again said he would have to publish it. They
were about two paces from me. Dame spoke low, as if careful
to avoid being heard. Haight spoke loud, and said, “You
know that you counselled it, and ordered me to have them
used up.” Dame said, “I did not think that there were so
many women and children. I thought they were nearly all
killed by the Indians.” Haight said, “It is too late in the
day for you to back water. You know you ordered and counselled
it, and now you want to back out.” Dame said, “Have
you the papers for that?” or “Show the papers for that.”
This enraged Haight to the highest pitch, and Dame walked
off. Haight said, “You throw the blame of this thing on me,
and I will be revenged upon you, if I have to meet you in hell
to get it.” From this place we rode to the waggons; we found
them stripped of their covers and every particle of clothing,
even the feather beds had been ripped open and the contents
turned upon the ground, looking for plunder. I crossed the
mountains by an Indian trail, taking my little Indian boy with
me on my horse. The gathering up of the property and cattle
was left in the charge of Bishop P. K. Smith. The testimony of
Smith in regard to the property and the disposition of it was
very nearly correct.</p>

<p>I must not forget to state, that after the attack a messenger
by the name of James Haslem was sent with a despatch to
President Brigham Young, asking his advice about interfering
with the company, but he did not return in time. This I had
no knowledge of until the massacre was committed. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
two weeks after the deed was done, Isaac C. Haight sent me
to report to Governor Young in person. I asked him why he
did not send a written report. He replied that I could tell
him more satisfactorily than he could write, and if I would
stand up and shoulder as much of the responsibility as I
could conveniently, that it would be a feather in my cap some
day, and that I would get a celestial salvation, but that the
man who shrank from it now would go to hell. I went and
did as I was commanded. Brigham asked me if Isaac C.
Haight had written a letter to him. I replied, not by me, but
I said he wished me to report in person. “All right,” said
Brigham; “were you an eye-witness?” “To the most of it,”
was my reply. Then I proceeded and gave him a full history
of all except that of my opposition. That I left out entirely.
I told him of the killing of the women and children, and the
betraying of the company. That, I told him, I was opposed
to, but I did not say to him to what extent I was opposed to
it, only that I was opposed to shedding innocent blood.
“Why,” said he, “you differ from Isaac (Haight), for he said
there was not a drop of innocent blood in the whole company.”
When I was through, he said that it was awful; that he cared
nothing about the men, but the women and children was what
troubled him. I said, “President Young, you should either
release men from their obligation or sustain them when they
do what they have entered into the most sacred obligations to
do.” He replied, “I will think over the matter, and make it a
subject of prayer, and you may come back in the morning and
see me.” I did so, and he said, “John, I feel first-rate; I
asked the Lord if it was all right for that deed to be done, to
take away the vision of the deed from my mind, and the Lord
did so, and I feel first-rate. It is all right. The only fear I
have is of traitors.” He told me never to lisp it to any mortal
being, not even to Brother Heber. President Young has
always treated me with the friendship of a father since, and
has sealed several women to me since, and has made my house
his home when in that part of the territory, until danger has
threatened him. This is a true statement according to the
best of my recollection.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLV">KILLING A RIVAL PROPHET.</h2>

<p>Enough has been already written to satisfy all with whom
facts have any weight that the Mormonism which claims in
Europe to be “of Christ,” is in Utah a despotism of the
harshest character, allied to falsehood, murder, and the worst of
crimes that degrade human nature. And here would I rest my
pen; but it seems that one other episode in Utah life should
still be added, showing as it does the intolerance of the ruling
Mormon Priesthood when their own sway is challenged.</p>

<p>Thirty-five miles north of Salt Lake City—a short distance
from where the Union Pacific debouches from Weber Canyon—a
Welchman named Joseph Morris had found eager listeners
to new revelations. The Bishop of Kington Fort, Richard
Cook, formerly a noted Missionary in Manchester, England,
and a number of intelligent men and women, received gladly
the new prophet who had been raised up by “the Lord” to
“deliver Israel from bondage.” Numerous believers in a very
short time gathered from various parts of the territory, and
Kington fort, on the Weber, became an important place.
Morris abounded with revelations. His “gifts” exceeded in
profusion those of all who had ever gone before him. The
founder of Mormonism was nothing in comparison with his
disciple from Wales. The adherents of the new prophet
were perfectly overjoyed at the abundance of light that now
shone upon their path, and some very intelligent men gathered
to the Weber. Three English and three Danish clerks were
daily employed in writing the heavenly communications from
the mouth of the new prophet. Brigham had been barren—Morris
was overflowing. The new disciples “consecrated”
all they possessed to a common fund. Christ was seen to descend
among them, and their wants would only be of short
duration. As “the Lord” tarried, the enthusiasm of some of
the converts cooled, and here began the difficulty with the new
prophet. It became a question how much of their property
they could reclaim. It had all been “consecrated.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
leading men of the sect decided to let them peacefully retire;
but it was expected that they would honestly meet their accrued
share of the obligations of the little colony. Some of them
proved dishonest, and attempted to take away better cattle
than they had brought, and they refused to make allowance
for the support they had derived from the property of others.
A feud arose, the dissenters applied to the Mormon Courts, and
the latter were pleased with the opportunity afforded. Writs
were issued, served and repulsed. The dissenters waited for
the chance of seizing the moveable property of the colony,
and as wheat was sent to mill they pounced upon it, and took
teams and waggons as well. On one occasion the Morrisites
arose early in the morning, and spread themselves over the
country, keeping within view of the advancing teams. As
the dissenter and two others pounced upon the convoy the
second time, up sprang the Morrisites from places of concealment,
and took them prisoners. They were taken to Kington
Fort and imprisoned. The friends of the captured men sought
their release ineffectually, for the Sheriff in that country could
do nothing. One or two of the wives of the prisoners went to
Brigham, but he refused to interfere. He was too shrewd to
meddle directly in the affair. Justice Kinney was next visited.
As judge of that judicial district a petition was filed before
him, setting forth that these men were kept in close confinement
and heavily ironed by order of Joseph Morris, John
Banks, and Richard Cook. On the 24th of May, 1862, a writ
of habeas corpus was issued to the Territorial Marshal, and by
his deputy served, but no attention was paid to it. On the
11th of June a second writ was issued and was also disregarded.
Kinney was intensely indignant, and insisted upon the militia
being called out as a posse comitatus to accompany the Territorial
Marshal. Acting Governor Fuller issued the necessary
order. The Morrisites had been warned by the “Lord” that the
“Brighamites” were plotting their destruction, and accordingly
purchased all the rifles and ammunition possible. Early on
the morning of the 13th of June an armed posse were seen
on South Mountain overlooking the Morrisite community, and
the following proclamation was sent to the Morrisites by one
of their herd-boys:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">Head-quarters, Marshal’s Posse, Weber River,<br />
June 13, 1862.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>To Joseph Morris, John Banks, Richard Cook, John Parsons,
and Peter Klemgard</i>:</p>

<p>Whereas you have heretofore disregarded and defied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
judicial officers and laws of the Territory of Utah: and
whereas certain writs have been issued for you from the Third
Judicial District Court of said Territory, and a sufficient force
furnished by the executive of the same to enforce the laws.
This is therefore to notify you to peaceably and quietly surrender
yourselves and the prisoners in your custody forthwith.
An answer is required in thirty minutes after the receipt of
this document; if not, forcible measures will be taken for
your arrest. Should you disregard this proposition and place
your lives in jeopardy, you are hereby required to remove
your women and children: and all persons peaceably disposed
are hereby notified to forthwith leave your encampment, and
are informed that they can find protection with this posse.</p>

<p>A gentleman who was then in the Morrisites camp has furnished
the author with the following statement:—Morris, a
firm believer in the revelations he received, remarked, in answer
to the inquiry “What shall be done?” that he would “go
and inquire of the Lord.” He was soon heard in solemn and
earnest prayer. In the meantime word was sent round the
camp for the people to at once assemble in meeting and
consult on the question. Women and children came together
hurriedly, yet there was no excitement, and soon the Bowery
was well filled. Morris was seen to come out from his dwelling
with a paper in his hand. This paper proved to be a
written revelation. His council were awaiting him. The
revelation was read to the council, and a peculiar document it
was. It purported to be from God, who was represented as
being pleased with his faithful people there, and as having
brought the posse against them to show his own power in the
complete destruction of their enemies. It also promised that
now the triumph of his people should come. Their enemies
should be smitten before them, but that not one of his faithful
people should be destroyed—that “not a hair of their heads
should be harmed.” The council at once stepped out into the
Bowery, close to which lived all the leading men, and, to save
time, singing was omitted, and the meeting was opened briefly
by prayer. John Parsons (previously a noted Mormon
preacher in London), in his clear sonorous voice, then read
the revelation. R. Cook arose to consult with the people as
to which should be obeyed—the proclamation demanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
surrender of the prisoners held in custody of Peter Klemgard,
and four of the leading men of the Church, or the revelation
forbidding the surrender of these men. Before the people had
a chance to speak or vote, or do anything at all in the matter,
the booming sound of a cannon was heard, and screams arose
from the third seat from the stand in the Bowery, and instantly
two women were seen dead in the congregation, and the lower
jaw, hanging only by a small strip of skin, was shot off a young
girl of from twelve to fifteen years of age. It was the fearful
and heart-rending screams of this girl that stopped the meeting.
The people arose in utter confusion. Cook, still on his
feet, suggested to all to go at once to their homes, and that
each man should take care of his own family as best he could.
Never was a revelation more immediately falsified, for scarcely
had the promise of absolute safety been made than sudden
destruction came. Panic-stricken men and women rushed
hither and thither, some seeking safety in cellars, some in
potato-pits; in short, anywhere or in any place in which
security could be either reasonably or unreasonably hoped for.
The first shot was in a few minutes followed by another and
still another, and the attack was continued. The posse drew
nearer and nearer, and the firing was kept up incessantly both
with cannon and musketry. Had Burton or McKean had the
pluck of a common constable, they could have gone safely into
the fort, served the summons, and saved all effusion of blood.
There was not a Morrisite in the fort that was armed or
thought of arming. They met to consider the question, and to
pray over it. About an hour and a half after the firing commenced
they got their arms and effected an organization, and
a regular defence was made. After fighting three days they
raised the white flag, and ceased firing. Cautiously Burton
and his aids, with a number of men, entered into the camp,
and then transpired a bloody scene, concerning which the
following affidavit has been made:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">United States of America, Territory of Utah, S.S.</p>

<p>Alexander Dow, of said territory, being duly sworn, says:
“In the spring of 1861 I joined the Morrisites, and was
present when Joseph Morris was killed. The Morrisites had
surrendered, a white flag was flying, and the arms were all
grounded and guarded by a large number of the posse. Robert
T. Burton and Judson L. Stoddard rode in among the Morrisites.
Burton was excited. He said, “Where is the man?
I don’t know him.” Stoddard replied, “That’s him,” pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
to Morris. Barton rode his horse upon Morris, and commanded
him to give himself up in the name of the Lord.
Morris replied, “No, never, never!” Morris said he wanted
to speak to the people. Burton said, “Be d—d quick about
it.” Morris said, “Brethren, I’ve taught you true principles.”
He had scarcely got the words out of his mouth before Burton
fired his revolver. The ball passed in his neck or shoulder.
Burton exclaimed, “There’s your prophet.” He fired again,
saying, “What do you think of your prophet now?” He
then turned suddenly and shot Banks, who was standing five
or six paces distant. Banks fell. Mrs. Bowman, wife of
James Bowman, came running up crying, “Oh, you bloodthirsty
wretch!” Burton said, “No one shall tell me that and
live,” and shot her dead. A Danish woman then came running
up to Morris, crying, and Burton shot her dead also.
Burton could easily have taken Morris and Banks prisoners,
if he had tried. I was standing but a few feet from Burton
all this time. And further saith not.</p>

<p>In the fight two of the Marshal’s posse were killed, and six
of the Morrisites, and three of the latter were wounded. Only
one in the Morrisite camp was killed by rifle-ball. It was the
cannon at long range that did the damage. The first shot
killed two women as before stated, and wounded a girl; another
cannon-ball killed a woman and her child in the “wickiup.”
The mother-in-law of the new prophet was also killed in her
“wickiup.” A little infant had two narrow escapes. The
first shot killed its mother, Mrs. Marsh, while it was in her
arms, and it was in the arms of Mrs. Bowman when she was
shot down. After the surrender all the prisoners were
marched to Salt Lake on the 17th, and on the 18th they were
examined before Judge Kinney in chambers, and placed under
bonds to appear at the next regular term of Court. In urging
measures against the Morrisites, Kinney claimed to be satisfied
that he did only do his duty. It is difficult to see how he could
long be passive when the order of his Court was disregarded.
Burton committed the atrocity of which he is accused most
undoubtedly, and it was the work of a devoted fanatic, who,
seeking to please the Prophet Brigham, did not hesitate to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
so by ridding him of a troublesome rival. That John Banks
was foully dealt with there seems little room to doubt. He was
wounded at the time of Morris’s death, but not fatally. The
manner of his “taking off” only is obscure. In the evening he
was well enough to sit up and enjoy his pipe. Suddenly he died.
Was he poisoned, shot, or “knifed?” is the only query. It is
generally believed that Dr. Clinton “knifed him.” Banks was
among the first to receive Mormonism in Preston, Lancashire,
England. He was soon ordained a high-priest, and during many
years of labour among the Saints he had presided over the
largest conferences in Britain, and at one time was one of the
Presidency over the whole Church there. He was the most
eloquent preacher that was ever in the Mormon Church. As
his faith waned in Mormonism he was painfully grieved, and
at times became intemperate. Before he was a Mormon he
had been a Chartist, and the “despotism” of the ruling Priesthood
was irksome to him. Years before he left England for
Zion he silently mourned over the one-man power. His best
life had been spent for Mormonism, and he was then too far
advanced in years to begin a new life, and he emigrated to Zion
when ordered, hoping that his fears might be removed by better
experience. Brigham Young was personally kind to him after
he arrived at Salt Lake, and sought to help him over his
material troubles; but there was in the heart of John Banks
more than he could tell the Prophet. When he heard Morris,
it was the opening of a fresh career to him, and he eagerly embraced
the new faith.</p>

<p>Before the regular session of the Third Judicial District
Court, at which the Morrisites were to be tried, an element
was imported into Utah that was destined to trouble the happiness
of the Prophet. A new Governor, in the person of
Stephen S. Harding, of Indiana, was appointed to succeed
Dawson; and Thomas J. Drake of Michigan and Charles B.
Waite of Illinois, were appointed Associate Justices. At the
same time a body of California volunteers, under command of
Colonel Connor, were sent on the overland mail route to protect
that and the telegraph line across the Plains, but the Commander
had also instructions to establish posts near Salt Lake
City. At the March session of the Third Judicial District
Court the Morrisites were tried. Ten of them were indicted
for killing two of the posse during the flight; seven of these
were convicted, one was “nolled,” and two were acquitted.
Sixty-six others were fined $100 each for resisting the posse.
Of the seven convicted of “murder in the second degree,” one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment, one to twelve
years, and five to ten years each. Governor Harding, regarding
the prisoners as deserving of clemency, pardoned them all.
Most of those who had professed the Morrisite faith, and who
did not immediately leave the Territory, found employment
and refuge at Camp Douglas.</p>

<p>A month later, Colonel Connor took 250 of them and a company
of the California volunteers, to Soda Springs, where he
established a post in Idaho, immediately beyond the northern
Territorial limits of Utah, and the Morrisites have there lost
their peculiarities among a more humane population. After the
“Morrisite war” Burton enjoyed the respect of the community
and the honours of the Church. Offices and appointments were
showered upon him, and wives multiplied in his household. If
Brigham was horrified at the murder of Morris, Banks, and the
two women, he was unfelicitous in its expression. Burton
was, through his influence, made United States Assessor of
Internal Revenue, was made a Bishop of the Church, and grew
from Colonel Burton to Brigadier and Major-General. He
was made a member of the City Government and Sheriff of the
county of Great Salt Lake. His wealth increased with his
honours, and he was associated with Brigham in nearly all of
his enterprises. About four years ago the first move was made
against him by the grand jury for the murders on the Weber,
and he managed to conceal himself for about a year, and was
sent on a mission “to preach the gospel” in England, with the
indictment for murder hanging over him. There he was further
elevated, and when he returned to “Zion” he was again
honoured by being appointed the second counsellor to the chief
Bishop of the whole Mormon Church. For the last eighteen
months he has enjoyed perfect freedom, and has attended to
his numerous affairs with the utmost assurance that nothing
could be done with him, and in that he is probably correct, for
nothing has ever been done against a prominent Mormon like
Burton when a jury had the disposal of the business.</p>

<p>On the 6th of March, 1879, with all this evidence, and the
testimony of living eye-witnesses before them, Major-General
Burton was acquitted, by a jury in Salt Lake City, of the
murder of Mrs. Bowman!</p>
